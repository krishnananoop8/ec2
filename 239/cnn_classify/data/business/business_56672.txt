When did you get here?".Midway through the journey, if you're lucky enough to be stuck in traffic, then will you get into the most important question: "What do you do?".That's when I smile and they frown.I get excited that I have met a CEO, a vice president or the head of an NGO.They are disappointed that I'm a journalist.I'm quick to tell them that I'm not working and that everything is off the record. In cases such as this, when you have all of five minutes, it's crucial that you show your journalistic integrity and present them with a picture of a person rather than a journalist. I always think to myself: "Don't force it, be natural."This attitude has enabled to me make more contacts than on any other occasion.During a half hour shuttle journey on Thursday, I met a New York hedge fund manager, the chairman and CEO of Bayer, the VP of a Norwegian bank and many many more fascinating people.In true traditional networking style, they exit with well wishes and all, without exception, hand out their business cards.So forget LinkedIn -- come to Davos and the shuttle.Loading weather data ...
