If someone with the disease does not wash his or her hands before preparing food, the food can become contaminated.The disease infects the liver and causes jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin and eyes, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.

One or two of them are usually food handlers.The restaurant owner said that the infected employee is no longer "on the premises."
