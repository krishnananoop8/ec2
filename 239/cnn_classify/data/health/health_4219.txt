^_^Title^_^Recipe makeover: Lemon-ginger fried chicken ^_^Story^_^(CookingLight.com) -- September weekends are time for tailgates, whether it be on a college campus or at professional football stadium.A successful tailgate includes friends, some cold drinks and food.  It's a lot of food that's usually not the most healthful cuisine -- hot dogs, burgers, ribs, fried chicken. But fried chicken doesn't have to be swamped full of fat and sodium. Here's a recipe makeover that contains the secret to creating a skin-like crust (without the skin) on lightened pan-fried chicken.The reader: Robby Champion, independent education consultant, Staunton, Virginia The story: This entr&eacute;e's great taste made it a Champion favorite for years. In 1987, when Champion and her husband, Jim, discovered the recipe, it didn't have nutrition information.&quot;We absolutely love this dish, but it's easy to tell it isn't as healthful as we would like it to be,&quot; she says.They tried to lighten the recipe several times without success. &quot;We are trying to lead more healthful lives and want to enjoy this meal without feeling guilty,&quot; she explains. CookingLight.com: Tailgating menus  The dilemma: With one whole chicken serving two people, portions were oversized, yielding high calorie, fat, saturated fat, and sodium counts. The solution: For starters, the gargantuan portion sizes had to be brought down to size. A serving now includes either one breast half, or one thigh plus one drumstick; this brought the calories per serving down by about 300. Removing the skin from the meat and double-dredging the chicken maintained a crisp crust while shaving 317 calories, 17.4 grams of fat, and 4.7 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat per serving. To bring sodium under control, we swapped fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth for the regular version, and used 1 teaspoon kosher salt to season the four-serving yield. This trimmed 494 milligrams of sodium per serving.

I'm thrilled the new version maintains the flavor and texture of the original.&quot; CookingLight.com: Foods to boost your mindBefore | After 891 calories | 375 calories 45g total fat | 15.5 total fat  9.3 g saturated fat | 3.3g saturated fat 1,179mg sodium | 578mg sodium Giving the chicken a double coat of flour mixture creates a golden crust (without the skin) when pan-fried. We use lemon rind instead of the lemon extract called for in the original. Carefully pour in the broth so you don't wet the crispy brown coating on the chicken. The broth mixture turns into a glazey sauce that can be served with the chicken.
