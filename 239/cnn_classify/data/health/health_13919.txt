^_^Title^_^Your top health searches, asked and answered^_^Story^_^One day, Google's chief health strategist, Dr. Roni Zeiger, had an epiphany: On any given day, more people are posing health questions to Google than posing health questions to their doctors.&quot;What amazes me is how much and how many people are looking for health information, and how important their questions are,&quot; says Zeiger, who's an internist. &quot;As a physician it's overwhelming and incredibly motivating.&quot;According to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, 83 percent of Internet users have looked online for health information. New data released by Pew this week show many people are now using cell phones to search for health information -- 29 percent of cell phone owners age 18 to 29, and 17 percent of cell owners overall. It's the first time Pew has surveyed health searches on cell phones.&quot;Health questions don't crop up at convenient times or in convenient places,&quot; says Susannah Fox, author of the report. &quot;Someone has a symptom and they want to know -- right now -- what it might mean.&quot;&quot;The Empowered Patient&quot; asked Google and Yahoo to tell us what health information you're looking for, both on computers and on mobile phones. There was a pretty clear difference between what you want to know when you're at your desk versus on your phone.According to Yahoo's data, three out of the five most popular health searches on cell phones have to do with sex: &quot;pregnancy,&quot; &quot;herpes,&quot; and &quot;STD&quot; (sexually transmitted diseases).Sex-related queries don't even show up on Google and Yahoo's list of top five health searches. &quot;Pregnancy&quot; is No. 7 on Yahoo's list, and &quot;herpes&quot; is No. 10 on Google's list.Part of the reason sex-related searches are more common on phones is that mobile health searchers tend to be in their 20s and 30s, Fox says, the typical age for pregnancy and for multiple partners. But she thinks it could be about more than just age -- it might also have to do with location.&quot;Do these sorts of questions crop up more often when someone is, let's say, not near a computer?&quot; she asks. Perhaps these are &quot;morning after&quot; searches, she continues, done by people wondering if they're pregnant or infected after a liaison.Whatever the reason, it's clear you're searching for health information online, and so &quot;The Empowered Patient&quot; has taken the lists from Yahoo and Google and come up with five of the most commonly searched health terms. Since searches don't always lead to the most useful results, we've done the work for you and led you to some of the most useful information on the Internet for each topic.(Yahoo's data are based on searches in the past four months, and are not published online. Google's data are published online and based on searches in the past year. The Google list is constantly changing based on new searches; the numbers in this story are based on the list accessed Tuesday afternoon.)HerpesHerpes is No. 2 on Yahoo's mobile list, and No. 10 on Google's regular list.Search results Empowered Patient found most useful:&#8226;  Overview of herpes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8226; Herpes symptoms in women have from the National Women's Health Information Center.&#8226; Herpes symptoms in men from Livestrong.&#8226; Where to find a herpes testing site near you from the CDC.&#8226; First-person accounts of people who've had herpes from The American Social Health Association&#8226; State-by-state list of herpes social and support groups from Dating with Herpes.&#8226; A calendar of social events for people with herpes from the National H Club.&#8226; Animation on how to use a condom to try to keep yourself from getting herpes from the American Social Health Association.Pregnancy Pregnancy is No. 1 on Yahoo's mobile list.

For example, she says people now might search for &quot;preventing heart attacks with aspirin&quot; rather than just search for &quot;heart disease.&quot;Heather Cabot, web life editor at Yahoo, agrees that Internet users are smarter than ever about how they search -- and they're better off because of it.&quot;I think we're better advocates for ourselves because of the Internet,&quot; she says. &quot;It's empowering to be able to know what all your options are.&quot;CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.Loading weather data ...
