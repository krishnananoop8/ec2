^_^Title^_^Gift guide: Tech toys and gadgets for kids^_^Story^_^Buying gadgets for kids these days seems simple: Just get them something with a glowing screen and they'll be satisfied.But there's more fun -- and educational -- stuff out there than phones, tablets and portable gaming devices.In compiling these suggestions we've sought to emphasize tech gifts that are -- horrors! -- educational as well as fun. Here are chemistry sets, model rockets and little renewable-energy cars you build yourself. (OK, we threw a tablet in there, too.)Some of these require assembly and would make fun parent-child projects, if you have time for that.If you don't, we offer a portable speaker in the shape of a panda. Happy shopping!Gift guide: Great gadgets for adultsHave any suggestions for great tech gifts? Let us know in the comments below.
