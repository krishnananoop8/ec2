^_^Title^_^Environmentalist: It's becoming a plastic world^_^Story^_^Every bit of fully synthetic plastic that's ever been produced over the past 100 years is somewhere on our planet, a leading environmentalist, David de Rothschild, said Tuesday.De Rothschild, who's about to set sail on a boat made of recycled plastic to highlight pollution in the Pacific Ocean, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour there has been a huge aggregation of small molecular-sized pieces of plastic in our atmosphere, in our oceans, or on our land since plastic was first produced in 1909.&quot;We're seeing them aggregating ... and getting into the food chain, which is then transferring toxins back into us through the food we eat,&quot; de Rothschild said.&quot;We have this sort of voracious appetite for throwaway, single-use plastics, what I call Dumb Planet 1.0 plastics -- the plastic bag, the Styrofoam cup.&quot;De Rothschild said he will set sail on his boat, called the Plastiki, some time in the next 10 days, depending on the weather and other factors.His catamaran-style boat is made principally of 12,500 reclaimed plastic water bottles, which are designed to keep his vessel afloat, while the main frame is constructed from polyethylene terephthalate -- a recyclable plastic material used in food and beverage containers and other products.His aim during a 100-day voyage that will take him from San Francisco, California, to Sydney, Australia, is to find the &quot;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&quot; between California and Japan -- a massive sea of plastic trash that environmentalists say could soon be larger than the continental United States.&quot;What I think people need to realize is that there are five (patches), not just one&quot;, he added. &quot;We are seeing a convergence zone in our oceans -- the North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and the west coast of Australia.&quot;He said he has two goals. The first is to raise public awareness of the huge amounts of plastic that are polluting the planet. The second is to get people to &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle, and rethink&quot; those everyday items that people now throw away as garbage.Former Greenpeace activist Annie Leonard, author of the book &quot;The Story of Stuff,&quot; and host of an online video, said 99 percent of all the materials that flow through the production process becomes trash within six months.Leonard said she loves &quot;her stuff&quot; as much as anyone. But she wants people to be more aware of where it comes from so everyone can be a little more conscious of all the materials that flow through our lives.She also said there are great opportunities to help remedy the pollution situation -- in the field of green chemistry, for example.&quot;Chemists are replacing toxic chemicals with brand-new molecules that are actually designed from the very molecular level to be compatible with ecological systems,&quot; she said, &quot;So that we can have glues and dyes and pigments that don't poison the workers or the communities.&quot;Meanwhile, Economics Professor Russ Roberts of George Mason University just outside Washington, told Amanpour that &quot;although it's pleasurable to have toys and have goodies and have a big house, they come at a price.&quot;But he said people should not confuse the desire to get out of poverty and get a better standard of living with being a gross materialist.&quot;It's a matter of moderation and balance,&quot; Roberts said.He added that he wants a less powerful government, because he thinks government now oversteps its bounds and often protects businesses at the expense of consumers.&quot;A business that's left in a competitive world, without the government's help, the way it thrives is by making better, safer, and healthier products that use less waste, because that keeps the price down,&quot; Roberts said.Loading weather data ...
