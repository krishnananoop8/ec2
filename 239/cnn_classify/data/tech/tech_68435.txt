^_^Title^_^Samsung dives into 3-D, e-reader, MP3 worlds^_^Story^_^Las Vegas, Nevada Samsung dove headfirst on Wednesday into a number of technology trends already making waves at the Consumer Electronics Show.In a whirlwind press conference, the electronics company downplayed the impact of the recession on the electronics industry before revealing a new e-reader in partnership with Google Books, an open-source app store for television sets, an MP3 player with a translucent screen and a 3-D television that's said to be the width of a pencil.Through all of the announcements, though, the South Korean company seemed most focused on expanding the capabilities of home televisions -- making them more connected to the Internet and other devices and, now, with the launch of &quot;Samsung Apps&quot; in the spring, giving them the ability to do whatever tech developers want them to do.Television &quot;can be almost anything you want it to be,&quot; said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung electronics in North America. &quot;TV can be your DJ, your gaming opponent, your travel adviser, your weather man. TV can even go shopping with you.&quot;With the help of 3-D technology, its content also can jump off the screen. Samsung is one of a number of TV makers here promoting televisions able to create three-dimensional images with the help of 3-D glasses and content.It announced a package of 3-D TV products -- from Blu-ray players to the glasses, and a home theater -- which is expected to go on sale later this year.To emphasize the fact that 3-D content is going to become available for home viewing, Samsung trotted out DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who said the company's 3-D animated film, &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens,&quot; will be available for purchase later this year.&quot;Today, because of 3-D, we stand at a watershed moment for the entire movie industry,&quot; Katzenberg said, adding that 3-D TV is capitalizing on the medium's popularity and profitability in theaters.DreamWorks, Samsung and Technicolor announced a partnership to promote and produce 3-D TV.But, if the movie studios don't cooperate, Samsung said one of its upcoming Blu-ray players will be able to up-convert standard 2-D content into three dimensions. Baxter did not elaborate on that technology.A new line of uber-thin LCD televisions drew applause from the crowd in Las Vegas, Nevada. Samsung claimed to reveal the world's thinnest LED television, which, at a third of an inch wide, is &quot;actually the width of a pencil,&quot; Baxter said.Samsung also jumped into the e-reader fray -- another big CES topic -- by announcing gadgets readers can use to read digital books on 6-and-10-inch screens. Called the E6 and E101, the e-book readers will be Wi-Fi enabled and will be able to store up to 1,200 books, the company said.In a video clip played at the event, Google spokesman Gabriel Stricker said the tech giant is happy to partner with Samsung to provide its more than 1 million public domain books for viewing on the Samsung readers.Both of Samsung's new e-readers also act like paper, allowing users to jot down notes on the screen.Finally, Baxter promoted a 2-inch MP3 player, the IceTouch, with a translucent AMOLED touch-screen -- a technology he said hadn't been used on portable music players before.Being able to see through the screen keeps users from having to put their fingers in front of a video they might be watching, Baxter said.&quot;Since you can control it from the back, your fingers won't block the screen,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll tell ya, it's so stylish you won't want to keep it in your pocket.&quot;Loading weather data ...
