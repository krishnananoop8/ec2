^_^Title^_^ Y2K fever to heat up in '99 ^_^Story^_^Consider also that the U.S. government is advising that citizens take         some of the same sorts of precautions for the millennium's arrival as         they would for an impending blizzard or hurricane.       "We don't have a set of formal recommendations," said Don Meyer, spokesman         for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Problem, which         is headed by Utah Republican Bob Bennett. "What Sen. Bennett has been         saying publicly is that it wouldn't hurt to have a few days of food on         hand, a little bit of cash."       The committee aims to be "a repository of truthful and accurate information,"         dispelling rumors of mass shortages of basic necessities and allaying         fears about widespread disruptions in utilities, telecommunications and         banking, for instance.       But the committee's scope is limited. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management         Agency (FEMA) -- the same entity that reacts to natural disasters -- is         charged with developing a national contingency plan if civil unrest occurs.         Meyer said FEMA is "a bit behind" in planning, so the committee is attempting         to spread a calming message.       "A lot of things, I think, would have to go wrong in order for this widespread         civil unrest to become a reality," Meyer said. He added that barring a         "prolonged" power outage in a major metropolitan area, not much mayhem         is expected.       The committee has conducted hearings to examine how various industry         segments are reacting and said it is confident that widespread power grid         outages or banking failures won't occur. "That doesn't mollify our fears         that a plan should be in place," he said.       The government's decision to create such a plan is in itself seen by         some as evidence that chaos will occur. Others caution that gloom-and-doom         prophecies will be self-fulfilling. To some degree, that's happening already,         as seen in specialty retail markets.       U.S. sales of pricey models of Swiss Katadyne water filters have doubled         in the past few months, and all filters made by the company are on back         order at the distributor, Suunto USA, said Vana Huynh customer service         manager.       Many of those who order say they are buying the filters because of worries         about how the year 2000 bug will affect water purification, Huynh said.       Given "the volume of our sales, they are unable to keep up with production,"         Huynh said. "We're just getting orders in every day, and it's tremendous."       Katadyne's most popular filter in the past was a lightweight pocket model         for backpackers, but demand has surged for all of the company's products,         including the $1,143 Expedition Filter, designed for heavy-duty use.       The same thing is happening at Recreational Equipment Inc. in Reading,         Mass., which has seen a surge in purchases of water filters, iodine tablets,         lanterns, stoves, fuel and dehydrated food.       "Every other day I'll run into someone who's talking about it," -- "it"         being the year 2000 -- said Bruce Hamilton, a sales associate at the store.         "They seem to be a little offbeat, to put it politely."       Dehydrated food is flying off the shelves, with customers paying $5.50         for shiny pouches of spaghetti marinara with mushrooms or $4.30 for turkey         tetrazzini. "It's hard for us to keep it on the shelf," Hamilton said.         "One customer wanted to buy $500 worth of dehydrated food."       As some people start stockpiling supplies through 1999, that will fuel         panic, some observers say. "I do believe there will be some runs on banks,"         said Michael Harden, president and chief executive officer of Century         Technology Services Inc. in McLean, Va. The company makes software and         offers services to help inventory and track year 2000 compliance.       The rush to remove cash from some banks could start as soon as late next         summer, and "whether that bank is compliant enough probably won't matter,"         Harden said.       "I believe it's too early to understand the full scope of what's going         to happen," he said. "I personally think it's going to be bad. I think         it depends on where you live. Some places may be without power. Others         may be fine .... If the breakdowns that occur in the infrastructure of         the country are significant, it will open up a lot of opportunities for         all kinds of fringe elements to do some rather drastic things."       On the other end of the opinion spectrum is Dave Wessel, designer and         developer of year 2000 software from Tominy Inc. in Cincinnati. While         he said "it's much, much, much too early to tell" what will happen, Wessel         also said there's so much hard work going on to fix the year 2000 problem         that major disaster will be averted.       "I don't believe we're going to have a catastrophe," he said. "I think         we're going to have some inconveniences. I think we're going to have some         problems, and they might last for six months."       Companies have gotten into gear to work on the problem. They also are         increasingly concerned about their suppliers' readiness. Sun Microsystems         Inc., for example, sent letters demanding proof of year 2000 compliance         to someone whose only work for the company has been to write material         for the marketing department, according to the contractor, who requested         anonymity.       The U.S. government isn't waiting to see if Jan. 1, 2000, passes without         consequence, according to the latest issue of "Intelligence Report." The         issue includes an interview with an FBI antiterrorism expert who said         the agency is deeply concerned that the threat of domestic terrorism will         escalate as the unyielding deadline approaches.       "It is important to stress, however, that the Y2K problem is not a technical         issue alone. World publics must be adequately informed not only about         the scale and importance of the problem, but also about its nature so         that the inevitable disruptions that will occur sometime, somewhere, in         the first days of the year 2000 do not trigger worldwide trepidation,         or even panic," wrote Jonathan Spalter, chairman of President Bill Clinton's         Council on the Year 2000 conversion working group on international public         diplomacy.       Awareness among government leaders of a siege mentality was apparent         at a recent UN meeting on the year 2000 bug. Experts from more than 130         countries gathered at UN headquarters in New York to share information         and discuss emergency response plans.       One topic they touched on was what central banks should do about the         anticipated rush on cash that could cause a liquid capital shortage. The         solution emerging from a U.S. Federal Reserve Board presentation? Print         more money.       The UN meeting also focused on concerns that defense systems will go         haywire (see story).       "Let me put to rest the rumor that missiles are going to be flying everywhere         by accident," said John Koskinen, President Clinton's year 2000 czar.         Missiles launch only through human intervention, and if anything goes         wrong, defense systems are always turned off by default, Koskinen added.       The U.S. government is said to be far ahead of other nations in correcting         the year 2000 bug in its systems, although a quarterly report card consistently         finds some agencies and bureaus seriously lagging. The U.S. Federal Aviation         Administration, whose antiquated computer systems do little to inspire         confidence anyway, has been particularly targeted as needing to do serious         work to handle the glitch. Despite that, Koskinen has pledged to be on         an airplane as the millennium rolls in. Bennett, chairman of the Senate         committee charged with disseminating accurate information, isn't quite         so confident.       "He won't be heading for the hills," committee spokesman Meyer said.         "But on the other hand, he won't be doing what Koskinen said he's going         to do. He won't be in the seat next to him."       Special               section:Related               stories:                External sites are not                  endorsed by CNN Interactive.
