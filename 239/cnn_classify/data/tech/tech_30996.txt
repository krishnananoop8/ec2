Watch the debate: Part 1 I 2 I3 I4 I5 I6 &quot;I've never seen a moment in history when so many world leaders have taken an interest in this topic,&quot; de Boer said. &quot;We have 115 coming on Friday to get a strong resounding result out of this week.&quot;Daryl Hannah agreed: &quot;This is definitely a defining moment for our politicians and world leaders to take a stand to make real change from a fossil fuel economy to a new energy independent economy.&quot;But Bjorn Lomborg questioned whether world leaders would sign an agreement.&quot;One-hundred-and-fifteen leaders are coming to Copenhagen but what are they going to agree on?&quot; he said. &quot;Don't they want to do something smarter that will actually work this time.&quot;Thomas Friedman urged the United States to take a lead on climate change. &quot;Right now,&quot; he said, &quot;that is very much up in the air. The uncertainties surrounding climate change are not a reason for inaction. They are a reason to act.&quot;The panel answered a range of questions from YouTube users all over the world from the United States to Bangladesh and Brazil.A questioner from Morocco wanted to know if African countries had a loud enough voice at the climate talks.

We cannot resolve climate change in one nation, or one continent ND not in another,&quot; he continued. The Web broadcast was attended by an audience of delegates who are attending the U.N. climate conference at the Bella Center.
