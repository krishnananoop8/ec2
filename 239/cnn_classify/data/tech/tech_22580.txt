^_^Title^_^J.K. Rowling previews mysterious 'Pottermore' site^_^Story^_^Harry Potter fans, already an excitable bunch, are in a tizzy over a mysterious new website from series creator J.K. Rowling that hints at future Harry Potter-related content.The site, Pottermore.com, launched Thursday with a single teaser page depicting two owls against a dark pink background and the words &quot;Coming soon ...&quot; above Rowling's signature.Clicking either owl takes visitors to Rowling's YouTube channel, where a video screen counts down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until a Rowling &quot;announcement&quot; -- set for 7 a.m. ET Wednesday.There's also a new Pottermore Twitter account, which as of Friday morning had posted only two tweets: one linking to the YouTube page and another mentioning a Google Maps-powered puzzle game that revealed the letters &quot;POTTERMORE.&quot;Blogs and Twitter are full of fans hyperventilating about what it all means. &quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This Is like the most exciting thing that's happened in a realy long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've been freaking out and running around the house screaming :)&quot; posted one user on MuggleNet, a Harry Potter fan site.Guesses range from an online game to a digital comic book to a virtual Harry Potter encyclopedia to a new promotional effort for the final movie in the franchise, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,&quot; which hits theaters July 15.What it probably doesn't mean, however, is a new Harry Potter book. A representative for Rowling told UK newspaper The Guardian on Thursday, &quot;All we can say is that Pottermore is the name of J.K. Rowling's new project. It will be announced soon, and it is not a new book.&quot; Andrew Sims of MuggleNet wrote on Thursday: &quot;I saw a preview of Pottermore recently and can tell you that it is fantastic. I'd say more but I had to make an unbreakable vow concerning its secrecy.&quot;What do you think &quot;Pottermore&quot; will be? What do you want it to be?
