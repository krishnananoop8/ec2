^_^Title^_^Skype now available for Android devices^_^Story^_^(Mashable) -- After iOS, Skype is now available for the Android platform, but only on devices running Android version 2.1 or later.The Android app lets users make free Skype-to-Skype calls, as well as send and receive IMs for free. Calls to phones are charged at Skype's standard rates, and they work over both Wi-Fi and 3G. If you already have a Skype account, you'll be able to instantly access your contact list on your Android device after logging in.Skype for iPhone, which was launched in May 2010, is one of the most successful apps on the iOS platform, and we expect the Skype for Android to become a hit, too.Android users can install Skype on skype.com or through the Android Market. &copy; 2013 MASHABLE.com.
