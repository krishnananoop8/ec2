^_^Title^_^Why Facebook is blue -- six facts about Mark Zuckerberg^_^Story^_^The relatively private life of Facebook's founder -- or at least a fictionalized version of it -- is about to get much more public.A movie called &quot;The Social Network,&quot; based on the life of Facebook's sweatshirt-wearing co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, hits theaters on October 1. Truly biographical or not, the film is sure to thrust the 26-year-old Zuckerberg further into the spotlight, making him a household name if he's not already. His site, after all, is used by a half-billion people around the world.We searched the Internet for info about Zuckerberg and created this list of six fun and little-known facts about the man behind Facebook. Much of it is pulled from a notable profile of Zuckerberg in The New Yorker, which has had the Internet buzzing since it published online earlier this month.Take a look and let us know what you think. What choice details did we miss? You can leave us a note in the comments section, or send a reply to the @cnntech account on Twitter.The king of public is private in real lifeZuckerberg is a fan of saying that, with Facebook, he wants to make the world a more open and honest place -- where people share details about themselves with the world. So it could be perceived as ironic -- if not hypocritical -- that Zuckerberg keeps some details private on his own Facebook page.In a recent profile of Zuckerberg, Jose Antonio Vargas of The New Yorker writes that the CEO of the world's largest online social network is rather shy and private.&quot;He doesn't like to speak to the press, and he does so rarely,&quot; Vargas writes. &quot;He also doesn't seem to enjoy the public appearances that are increasingly requested of him.&quot;The interests he lists on Facebook are bizarreFrom Shakira to &quot;ending desire,&quot; the interests Zuckerberg lists on his private Facebook page are certainly unexpected if not plain bizarre.Under interests, he lists the following: &quot;Eliminating Desire, Minimalism, Making Things, Breaking Things, Information flow, Revolutions, Openness.&quot;His favorite musicians include Daft Punk and Lady Gaga.Among his favorite TV shows, he lists &quot;The West Wing,&quot; which, as The New Yorker's profile of Zuckerberg points out, was written by Aaron Sorkin, the man who wrote the screenplay for the upcoming movie about Facebook.He's a classics buff with an &quot;imperial tendency&quot;Zuckerberg grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and graduated from high school at Phillips Exeter Academy. There, he studied Latin and became a fan of the classics. At Harvard University, which he attended for two years before dropping out to pursue Facebook, Zuckerberg &quot;was known for reciting lines from epic poems such as &quot;The Iliad,'&quot; writes Jessica Vascellaro in The Wall Street Journal.Zuckerberg also built games with classical themes.&quot;The first significant program Zuckerberg ever designed was a game based on the living room classic Risk,&quot; Michael Grynbaum, then of the Harvard Crimson, wrote in 2004.&quot;It was centered around the ancient Roman Empire,&quot; Zuckerberg told the college paper at the time. &quot;You played against Julius Caesar. He was good, and I was never able to win.&quot;A friend told The New Yorker that Zuckerberg has an &quot;imperial tendency.&quot;'Zuck' has at least a few nicknamesFriends and co-workers call him &quot;Zuck.&quot; For proof, check out this memo on Facebook's blog, called &quot;Working with Zuck,&quot; in which Facebook software engineer Andrew Bosworth (or &quot;Boz&quot;) rattles off a bunch of notes about what it's like to work with Zuckerberg. &quot;Zuck expects debate ... Zuck isn't sentimental ... Zuck pushes people,&quot; and so-on, the blog post says. But Zuckerberg has earned other nicknames, too. The Wall Street Journal says his mom used to call him &quot;Princely&quot; when he was young. When he joined the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity at Harvard, his friends took to calling him &quot;Slayer,&quot; writes Rebecca Davis O'Brien, who attended Harvard with Zuckerberg and wrote a piece about him in The Daily Beast.The reason Facebook is blue: Zuckerberg is colorblindAccording to The New Yorker, Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind, which means the color he can see best is blue. That also happens to be the color that dominates the Facebook website and mobile app.&quot;Blue is the richest color for me,&quot; he told the magazine. &quot;I can see all of blue.&quot;Money doesn't matter much to ZuckerbergZuckerberg doesn't seem to care that much about money. One big piece of evidence to support this idea: Zuckerberg hasn't sold Facebook despite the fact that he's reportedly been offered at least $1 billion for it.Terry Semel, the former CEO of Yahoo! who reportedly offered Zuckerberg that sum, told the New Yorker that he'd never met a person who would turn down a $1 billion offer. &quot;He [Zuckerberg] said, 'It's not about the price. This is my baby, and I want to keep running it, I want to keep growing it,'&quot; Semel said, recalling his conversation with Zuckerberg in 2006. &quot;I couldn't believe it.&quot; The Harvard newspaper picked up on the same sentiment.&quot;That's just like not something we're really interested in,&quot; he told the paper in 2004, referring to offers from companies wanting to buy Facebook. &quot;I mean, yeah, we can make a bunch of money -- that's not the goal.&quot;Loading weather data ...
