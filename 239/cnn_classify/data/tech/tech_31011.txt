^_^Title^_^Koreans make plastics without fossil fuel chemicals^_^Story^_^A team of South Korean scientists have produced the polymers used for everyday plastics through bioengineering, rather than through the use of fossil fuel-based chemicals. It is believed that the technique may now allow for the production of environmentally-friendly plastic that is biodegradable and low in toxicity.  The research focused on Polylactic Acid (PLA), a bio-based polymer which holds the key to producing plastics through natural and renewable resources. Polymers are molecules found in everyday life in the form of plastics and rubbers. &quot;The polyesters and other polymers we use everyday are mostly derived from fossil oils made through the refinery or chemical process,&quot; Professor Sang Yup Lee, who lead the research, said in a press statement. &quot;The idea of producing polymers from renewable biomass has attracted much attention due to the increasing concerns of environmental problems and the limited nature of fossil resources. PLA is considered a good alternative to petroleum-based plastics, as it is both biodegradable and has a low toxicity to humans.&quot; Until now PLA has been produced in a two-step fermentation and chemical process of polymerization, which is both complex and expensive. The team used a metabolically engineered strain of E. coli and developed a one-stage process. &quot;By developing a strategy which combines metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering, we've developed an efficient bio-based one-step production process for PLA and its copolymers,&quot; said Lee. &quot;This means that a developed E. coli strain is now capable of efficiently producing unnatural polymers, through a one-step fermentation process. &quot;Global warming and other environmental problems are urging us to develop sustainable processes based on renewable resources. &quot;This new strategy should be generally useful for developing other engineered organisms capable of producing various unnatural polymers by direct fermentation from renewable resources.&quot; The research team from KAIST University in Seoul and the Korean chemical company LG Chem published their findings in the journal &quot;Biotechnology and Bioengineering&quot;.
