^_^Title^_^Samsung teases 10-Inch Galaxy Tab ^_^Story^_^(WIRED)  -- Well, well, well. What could Samsung be planning to do with this 10.1-inch LCD panel? The screen is on show at the the FPD International Green Device 2010 trade-show in China, and is displayed naked alongside versions in a prototype &quot;e-reader&quot; and a small notebook.Clearly, that &quot;e-reader&quot; is really a 10-inch Galaxy Tab: It's making a video call (not something you'd do on, say, a Kindle) and it has the same row of buttons on the bottom bezel as the smaller 7-inch Tab. The screen has a 1024×600 resolution and a 1,000:1 aspect ratio, but that's not the most interesting part. Not nearly.The panel is built using Samsung's existing manufacturing processes, only instead of using a glass substrate for the TFT it uses resin, which results in a tiny reduction in thickness (fro 0.5mm to 0.44mm), but a huge reduction in weight from 130g to just 28g, excluding backlights.WIRED: Galaxy Tab cheaper than iPad, but not reallyThis could lead to a significant reduction in the weight of tablet computers, which right now are a lot heavier than similar sized e-readers that lack glass in their screens. One spec that isn't mentioned is whether or not this screen is capable of multi-touch. We'd assume so, given the software and form-factor of the demo device. There appears to be some more work to do, though. Still, it's only a prototype.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!
