Robinson -- from his book, "Chained to the Desk: A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children, and the Clinicians Who Treat Them."I prefer to do most things rather than ask for help.I get impatient when I have to wait for someone else or when something takes too long.I always seem to be in a hurry and racing against the clock.I get irritated when I am interrupted while I am in the middle of something.I stay busy and keep many irons in the fire.I find myself doing two or three things at one time, such as eating lunch and writing a memo while talking on the phone.I over commit myself by biting off more than I can chew.I feel guilty when I am not working on something.It's important that I see the concrete results of what I do.I am more interested in the final result of my work than in the process.Things just never seem to move fast enough or get done fast enough for me.I lose my temper when things don't go my way or work out to suit me.I ask the same question over again after I've already been given the answer once.I spend a lot of time mentally planning and thinking about future events while tuning out the here and now.I find myself continuing to work after my coworkers have called it quits.I get angry when people don't meet my standards of perfection.I get upset when I am in situations where I cannot be in control.I tend to put myself under pressure from self-imposed deadlines when I work.It is hard for me to relax when I'm not working.I spend more time working than socializing with friends or on hobbies or leisure activities.I dive into projects to get a head start before all the phases have been finalized.I get upset with myself for making even the smallest mistake.I put more thought, time and energy into my work than I do my relationships with loved ones and friends.I forget, ignore or minimize celebrations such as birthdays, reunions, anniversaries or holidays.I make important decisions before I have all the facts and have a chance to think them through.Loading weather data ...
