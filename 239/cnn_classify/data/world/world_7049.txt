In addition, three members of Germany's Die Linke party were among those on the boat where nine people were killed, the party said Monday.German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called for a &quot;thorough and transparent investigation&quot; and called for border crossings to be opened to humanitarian aid convoys.&quot;I hope that the tragic events of last night will not make even more difficult the indirect talks between Israelis and Palestinians which have begun,&quot; he said. &quot;We believe it vital that this process go forward.&quot;Norway's Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said Norwegian citizens were aboard the convoy and called for an independent international inquiry &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;After meeting with the Israeli ambassador, the Greek Foreign Ministry said that the visit of the Israeli Joint Chiefs -- scheduled for Tuesday -- was being postponed and that the Greek-Israeli military exercise that was in progress had been discontinued.A Greek Foreign Affairs Ministry official could not say how many Greeks were aboard the six ships in the flotilla.Turkey recalled its ambassador from Israel, canceled three military exercises with the Israeli military and called home its youth national football team, which had two games scheduled in Israel, said Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc.&quot;This operation will leave a bloody stain on the history of humanity,&quot; he said. Protests occurred Monday outside the Israeli Embassy in Istanbul, Turkey.Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri predicted that the raid would inflame the region.&quot;Lebanon strongly condemns this attack and calls on the international community, and specifically on the major countries which are supposed to be responsible about the peace process, to take action in order to stop this continuous violation of human rights, which is putting the international peace at risk,&quot; Hariri said.Pakistan said it was concerned about the well-being and whereabouts of two journalists who were aboard the flotilla.&quot;The government of Pakistan strongly condemns the use of brazen force by Israel against a humanitarian mission that was embarked on delivering humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in Gaza,&quot; the country's foreign ministry said.&quot;The killing of members of this humanitarian mission, which also included women, is brutal, inhuman and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and norms.&quot;In a statement on its website, the Kingdom of Bahrain said it &quot;strongly condemns the Israeli navy's barbaric attack.&quot;The Vatican said it was following the situation &quot;with great attention and concern.&quot;Loading weather data ...
