You just cannot suffer anymore, you just have to come to the streets and protest,&quot; Noga Klinger, a protester, told CNN.Marching under the slogan, &quot;the people ask for social justice,&quot; students, young families and older Israelis protested in several major cities across Israel Saturday night, the largest in Tel Aviv. One protester in told CNN that he believes after Saturday night's protest the government &quot;will have to take us seriously.&quot;It is unclear whether the moves announced by Netanyahu will be enough to satisfy the growing protest movement.Netanyahu explained that the recommendations of the team will express the need to maintain fiscal responsibility in the budget. Speaking in reference to the downgrading of U.S. credit rating, and in light of growing financial uncertainty in Europe he stressed that his government &quot;must act under financial responsibility while making repairs that express social sensitivity.&quot;Netanyahu said he planned to hold a broad dialogue with the demonstrators, but added &quot;we cannot please them all.&quot;Loading weather data ...
