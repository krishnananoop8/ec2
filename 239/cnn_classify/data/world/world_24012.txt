The morning explosion happened near the municipality building in Falluja, about 37 miles (60 km) west of Baghdad. The bomb exploded near a group of construction day laborers. Falluja is a predominately Sunni town in Anbar province. This was the first serious attack since last week's Iraqi parliamentary elections. On Sunday, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's alliance took the lead after partial preliminary election results showed his group ahead in seven provinces, according to the electoral commission. On Monday, at least 60 percent of votes in all provinces will be tallied and partial results will be announced, elections officials said. Al-Maliki's State of Law alliance led in six southern Iraqi provinces and in Baghdad, where the most parliamentary seats -- 68 out of 325 -- are up for grabs, according to the electoral commission.
