He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children.Britain has been trying to deport Abu Qatada since 2005, but his legal appeals have kept him in the country.He was ordered back to prison earlier this month after evidence suggested he had violated his bail conditions. These include an order that prohibits him from allowing cell phones to be turned on in his house, and a ban on devices such as rewritable CDs and flash drives.READ MORE: Abu Qatada: the preacher at the eye of the storm
