^_^Title^_^Reports: Kenyatta has slim majority in Kenya presidential election^_^Story^_^Kenyan Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta -- who earlier was indicted for alleged crimes against humanity -- has received 50.03% of the votes in Kenya's presidential election, according to provisional results reported Friday by CNN affiliates KTN and NTV.If the result holds, Kenyatta would win the election without a runoff, as the victor needs only a simple majority. His nearest competitor, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, received 43.3% of the vote, according to the provisional results reported by the Kenyan broadcasters.An electoral commission is expected to announce official results Saturday morning. Kenya's presidential election took place Monday.If Kenyatta wins, he will find himself in an unusual quandary, as he has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for allegedly inciting a local militia to conduct reprisal attacks in the last election. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges at The Hague. Both have denied the accusations.Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's founding father, has said that if he is elected, the indictment will not affect his ability to do his job.
