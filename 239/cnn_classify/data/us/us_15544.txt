^_^Title^_^9/11 family members welcome, criticize civilian trials^_^Story^_^Some family members of 9/11 victims welcomed the announcement that five Guantanamo Bay detainees with alleged ties to the attacks will be tried in a New York civilian court, while others blasted the decision.&quot;I'm very, very disappointed in the government,&quot; said Anne Ielpi, whose son, Jonathan Ielpi, was a firefighter who was killed in the south tower.&quot;It's like throwing it in our face again,&quot; she said, speaking by phone Friday. &quot;We can't get away from 9/11, we can't.&quot;She said the five, who include confessed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, should be tried in military court.&quot;It definitely should have been finished in Cuba,&quot; she said.But others -- including members of the September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, some of whom spoke to reporters by phone on Friday -- said a civilian trial allows for transparency, noting that families of the victims could attend. Their access to a military trial would be more limited, they said.&quot;Here we can see what's going on,&quot; said Valerie Lucznikowska, whose nephew was killed in the attacks. &quot;Everyone in the world can see what's going on.&quot;John Leinung, whose stepson, Paul Battaglia, worked in the north tower, said the United States has a responsibility to &quot;operate under our existing system of laws.&quot;&quot;I think our traditional court system is very capable of convicting guilty people,&quot; he said.Dozens of family members of 9/11 victims have signed a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced the trial decision; President Obama; and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates opposing a civilian trial for the alleged plotters.They said it would give the men a well-publicized platform, blocks from where the towers stood, in which they could espouse their views.&quot;It is incomprehensible to us that members of the United States Congress would propose that the same men who today refer to the murder of our loved ones as a 'blessed day' and who targeted the United States Capitol for the same kind of destruction that was wrought in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, should be the beneficiaries of a social compact of which they are not a part, do not recognize, and which they seek to destroy: the United States Constitution,&quot; the letter said.However, Leinung said the trials offer an opportunity for justice.&quot;If we want the world to operate lawfully, if we want people to address their international grievances in a fair manner, we are under an obligation to do that ourselves,&quot; he said.Loading weather data ...
