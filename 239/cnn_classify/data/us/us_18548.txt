^_^Title^_^U.S. intelligence agencies reviewing data on two Boston bombing suspects^_^Story^_^U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are again reviewing all intelligence on the two suspects in the Boston bombing for clues about their motivations and connections to possible terrorist groups, U.S. officials tell CNN.In the hours since their identities were confirmed by the FBI, "there is a very methodical and in-depth analysis underway on these suspects and the connections they may have had to any overseas group," a senior U.S. official told CNN.Until Thursday, the Obama administration had not come up with any specific intelligence, including intercepts or online messages, indicating a threat to the Boston Marathon, according to officials CNN had spoken with previously. But now, with the identification of the suspects, and social media messages they have posted and other information coming to light, "we can focus more specifically on their potential connections overseas," the senior official said.U.S. officials tell CNN that agencies are going back through all relevant data -- such as intelligence reports, intercepts, jihadist websites and passport records -- they have collected to see if there is any information about the suspects and if there are potential links to international or domestic terrorist groups.However, the senior official also strongly emphasized that the intelligence community does not know at this point if there is an international connection or if the suspects were "inspired" or "influenced" by any overseas groups. He also reiterated that it is possible this was an act of domestic terrorism with no foreign nexus.
