^_^Title^_^Rockefeller impersonator convicted of murder^_^Story^_^A German-born man known for impersonating a Rockefeller was convicted of first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of his landlady's son in California.A California jury found Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter guilty of killing John Sohus, who disappeared at age 27 in 1985.Sohus' dismembered remains were found in 1994 by workers installing a pool at a home his mother once owned in San Marino, California.At the time of Sohus' disappearance, Gerhartsreiter had been renting a guesthouse from Sohus' mother, authorities said.Gerhartsreiter led a life of multiple identities, at one point assuming the identity of "Clark Rockefeller," a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job.A Boston tabloid dubbed him "Crockefeller." A 2010 made-for-TV movie, "Who Is Clark Rockefeller?" starring Eric McCormack as Gerhartsreiter, aired on the Lifetime network.Last year, he was serving a prison sentence in Massachusetts for kidnapping his then-7-year-old daughter from his ex-wife in 2008 when he was transferred to California to face charges in the Sohus case.
