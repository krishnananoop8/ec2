A 3-year-old victim was transferred to Boston Children's Hospital for treatment.Amputated limbsDr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, told reporters he treated many of the 29 patients who arrived at the hospital for shrapnel wounds."Many of the victims were hit with "a lot of small, metal debris," he said."Some people have asked already whether they were BBs or parts of bombs," he said, referring to earlier reports that ball bearings have been pulled from victims. "We can't say whether they were placed their intentionally or whether they were just part of the environment."He said the most serious wounds "have been combined, complex lower injuries that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue." Some of the patients had to have limbs amputated, Fagenholz added."A number of patients will require repeat operations and serial operations over the next couple of days," he said, adding that he had been in surgery for almost 14 hours.Describing the horrorTheresa Panter, who had been running in the marathon, described the scene as she approached the finishing line."When I heard the bomb and saw the reaction of the spectators, I was just alarmed. Then I was pushed back by a spectator and then a Boston Athletic official -- he grabbed a bunch of us and pushed us back. It was pretty upsetting."Her husband, Dr. Allan Panter, was in the crowd and described how he ended up tending to people on the streets."I saw at least six to seven people down next to me -- they protected me from the blast. One lady expired, one gentleman lost both his limbs, his lower extremities. Most of the injuries were mainly lower extremity injuries."I could not figure out why the young lady had expired, I could not find any injury on her thorax."Read the full wrap-up of the terror attack in BostonWitness: 'I saw blood everywhere'LZ Granderson: April 15, 2013, will serve as terrible reminder
