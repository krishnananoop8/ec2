^_^Title^_^'Avatar,' 'Hurt Locker' lead in Oscar nods^_^Story^_^For continuing coverage of the Oscar race and other breaking entertainment news, follow @CNNShowbiz on Twitter.  The biggest box-office hit of all time and a small independent film that grossed about $16 million led all comers when the nominations for the 82nd annual Academy Awards were announced Tuesday morning.The head-to-head competition between &quot;Avatar,&quot; the gigantic hit about the collision of two civilizations, and &quot;The Hurt Locker,&quot; a gritty film about a bomb disposal unit in Iraq, takes on additional drama since the directors of those two films -- James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow, respectively -- were once married to each other.The two films each earned nine nominations. Quentin Tarantino's World War II drama, &quot;Inglourious Basterds,&quot; followed with eight. Film festival favorite &quot;Precious: Based on the novel 'Push' by Sapphire&quot; and &quot;Up in the Air,&quot; starring George Clooney as a much-traveled &quot;career transition specialist,&quot; are each up for six Oscars, while the Disney-Pixar animated comedy &quot;Up&quot; got five. It's a year for &quot;films that were of little means with film of humongous means,&quot; said &quot;Precious&quot; producer Sarah Siegel-Magness. Ten films received best picture nominations, including Cameron's &quot;Avatar,&quot; Bigelow's &quot;The Hurt Locker,&quot; Tarantino's &quot;Inglourious Basterds,&quot; the feel-good hit &quot;The Blind Side,&quot; sci-fi thriller &quot;District 9,&quot; British coming-of-age film &quot;An Education,&quot; dark comedy &quot;A Serious Man,&quot; &quot;Precious,&quot; &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Up in the Air.&quot; See the complete list of nomineesThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doubled the number of movies nominated for best picture this year to 10, a move perhaps aimed at bolstering sagging ratings for the Academy Awards broadcast. Follow everything Oscar on CNN's 2010 Academy Awards specialIt is a return to the way the Oscars were awarded in the movies' early decades when as many as 12 films were considered in the field of finalists, then-academy President Sid Ganis said announcing the change in June.A best picture nomination often serves as a marketing boost, driving DVD sales for those films no longer in theaters.&quot;Precious,&quot; a gritty film about the struggles of a teen mother, got a major boost when talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and filmmaker Tyler Perry got behind the movie as executive producers after its success at the Sundance Film Festival.&quot;I believe it brought validity to 'Precious' ' story as a universal story, because Oprah and Tyler speak to the masses,&quot; Siegel-Magness said. &quot;When they speak, people listen.&quot;Acting award nominations closely followed the lead of the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Golden Globes, handed out in January.Best actor nominations went to: Jeff Bridges for &quot;Crazy Heart,&quot; Clooney for &quot;Up in the Air,&quot; Colin Firth for &quot;A Single Man,&quot; Jeremy Renner for &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; and Morgan Freeman for &quot;Invictus.&quot;Freeman, who played South African President Nelson Mandela, thanked director Clint Eastwood and co-star Matt Damon.&quot;Most importantly, thank you to Nelson Mandela for his encouragement, his blessing and his friendship -- without which, this film would not have been possible,&quot; Freeman said.Firth's reaction to news of his nomination was memorable.&quot;I thought I was managing my expectations, but on hearing the news I discovered new and unfamiliar vocal tones,&quot; Firth said. &quot;Perhaps I should do another musical.&quot;The best actress Oscar nominations include: Sandra Bullock for &quot;The Blind Side,&quot; Helen Mirren for &quot;The Last Station,&quot; Carey Mulligan for &quot;An Education,&quot; Gabourey Sidibe for &quot;Precious&quot; and Meryl Streep for &quot;Julie &amp; Julia.&quot;Streep's nomination gave her a record 16 Oscar nods -- extending her own mark -- well ahead of Katharine Hepburn and Jack Nicholson's 12 each.Mirren's nomination for playing the aging wife of Russian writer Leo Tolstoy gave &quot;The Last Station&quot; two chances to win an Oscar. Christopher Plummer, who played Tolstoy, is up for best supporting actor.&quot;I think Tolstoy himself would have been perplexed by all this, but Sofya, his wife, would have been over the moon,&quot; Mirren said. &quot;So in that spirit, I am too.&quot;Plummer said he hopes the nominations will call attention to the film. &quot;I liked the little movie,&quot; he said.While the nominations varied little from the SAG and Golden Globe choices, the best supporting actress category offered a surprise.Penelope Cruz was nominated for best supporting actress for &quot;Nine,&quot; a heavily promoted film that bombed at the box office. The movie received four nominations.&quot;I am completely surprised and elated,&quot; said Cruz, who won the best supporting actress Oscar last year for Woody Allen's &quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona.&quot; Another best supporting actress nominee that may have caught observers off-guard was Maggie Gyllenhaal for &quot;Crazy Heart.&quot; Though her co-star, Bridges, has dominated the lead actor categories for his role, the film marked Gyllenhaal's first nomination.Other best supporting actress nominees are Vera Farmiga, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;; Anna Kendrick, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;; and Mo'Nique, &quot;Precious.&quot;Mo'Nique carried home both the Golden Globe and SAG trophies last month.Kendrick said she went running in her neighborhood instead of watching the nominations that were telecast at 5:30 a.m. PT Tuesday.Her roommate sent her a text message with the news, she said.&quot;I was alone in the dark, listening to music,&quot; Kendrick said. &quot;It was really perfect, and it allowed me to have a moment.&quot;Best supporting actor nominations followed a script made familiar by the previous awards shows: Damon for &quot;Invictus,&quot; Woody Harrelson for &quot;The Messenger,&quot; Plummer for &quot;The Last Station,&quot; Stanley Tucci for &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and Christoph Waltz for &quot;Inglourious Basterds.&quot;Waltz, a veteran Austrian actor hardly known outside Europe until last year, won the Golden Globe and SAG awards last month. He played a memorable Nazi villain in Tarantino's thriller.The director category features a showdown between former spouses Cameron and Bigelow, along with nominations for Tarantino, Lee Daniels for &quot;Precious&quot; and Jason Reitman for &quot;Up in the Air.&quot;The 82nd Academy Awards show is set for March 7 at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre.CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.Loading weather data ...
