^_^Title^_^Bullock, Bridges win big at SAG Awards^_^Story^_^Los Angeles, California Sandra Bullock refuses to believe she has a chance at a best actress Oscar, even though she's now won the Screen Actors Guild award and a Golden Globe for &quot;The Blind Side.&quot;&quot;It's a fluke, I feel it's wrong,&quot; Bullock said. &quot;If you really want to know the truth, my money was on Meryl [Streep.]&quot;Fluke or not, a definite consensus is building about what actors turned in the best performances in the past year.With only one exception, the SAG Actor trophies handed out at the Shrine Auditorium Saturday went into the same hands that carried away Golden Globes from the Beverly Hilton Hotel in comparable categories last Sunday.While Bullock may not admit it, she -- along with Jeff Bridges and Mo'Nique -- have become favorites to be given Oscar statuettes on March 7 at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre. Academy Award nominations will be announced on February 2.The audience stood on their feet as Bridges walked to the stage to get his SAG trophy for outstanding lead actor in a movie.&quot;I love being an actor, you know, pretending to be other people, getting into their shoes,&quot; said Bridges, who played a washed-up country singer in &quot;Crazy Heart.&quot;For a second time in a week -- the first at the Golden Globes -- Bridges shut out George Clooney in the best actor category. He did offer a salute to his fellow nominees, especially Clooney.Mo'Nique summed it up with one word -- &quot;Wow!&quot; -- as she accepted the SAG Actor trophy award for supporting actress in a movie.The comedian's dramatic role as an abusive mother in &quot;Precious&quot; also earned her the best supporting actress Golden Globe a week ago.While NBC catches grief for the Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien controversy, its Alec Baldwin-Tina Fey comedic combo brought the network some good news.NBC's &quot;30 Rock&quot; co-stars won the awards for outstanding male and female actors in a comedy series. It's Fey's third consecutive year to win the SAG honor, and Baldwin has taken home the same trophy each of the past four years.Baldwin also claimed Emmys and Golden Globes in the same category this awards season; Fey took home an Emmy.In her acceptance speech, Fey made sure to separate herself from the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; debacle.&quot;I just wanted to take a moment to say to everyone at NBC, we are very happy with everything and happy to be there,&quot; Fey said.Backstage, Fey said &quot;things are looking up at NBC, and everything is settled.&quot;&quot;I'm glad for everybody that it is at least resolved,&quot; she said.&quot;30 Rock&quot; lost, however, to the Fox musical &quot;Glee&quot; for the award for outstanding ensemble in a TV comedy series.Julianna Margulies won the SAG award for outstanding female actor in a TV drama series almost a week after taking home the Golden Globe in the comparable category.She first thanked the show's writers, saying &quot;you get better and better with every episode.&quot;Margulies then thanked her parents, who she said take great interest in her every role &quot;except 'Snakes on a Plane.' They weren't so proud of that one, but they're proud of this one!&quot;&quot;Dexter&quot; star Michael C. Hall won the outstanding male actor in a drama series award. Like Margulies, Hall claimed the comparable award at the Golden Globes.Hall wore a knitted cap to cover his head, left bald by chemotherapy. He revealed this month that he was diagnosed with treatable Hodgkin's lymphoma.The cast of AMC's &quot;Mad Men&quot; won the SAG ensemble award for a drama series. It was their second straight year to take the Actor trophy, and -- like Margulies and Hall -- they also won the Golden Globe this year.Drew Barrymore was almost speechless when she was handed the award for outstanding female actor in a TV movie or miniseries for &quot;Grey Gardens.&quot;&quot;I am someone who wants to speak from my heart and spontaneously, and this is not going well,&quot; Barrymore said. &quot;Right now, I feel really sick and nervous, and that is a good thing because when you feel that way, I think you are on a good path, at least professionally.&quot;Kevin Bacon won the SAG Actor for outstanding performance by a male actor in a TV movie or miniseries for his role in HBO's &quot;Taking Chance.&quot;Bacon played a U.S. Marine Corps officer who escorts the body of a 19-year-old Marine back to his hometown. His speech thanked the sergeant who had the job of making him look like a Marine.The 16 SAG categories -- the only industry honors that solely recognize performers -- include both television and film actors.The first movie award handed out Saturday night went to Christoph Waltz for outstanding male supporting actor for his role as a villainous Nazi colonel in Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Inglourious Basterds.&quot;The 16th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards is aired on TNT and TBS. Both TNT and TBS are units of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.CNN's David Daniel contributed to this report.Loading weather data ...
