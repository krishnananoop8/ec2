^_^Title^_^'Buffy' creator to direct episode of 'Glee'^_^Story^_^Editor's Note: Michael Ausiello's column, &quot;The Ausiello Files,&quot; appears on EW.com. (Entertainment Weekly) -- If I hadn't been warming to &quot;Glee&quot; already, this for sure would've begun defrosting me: &quot;Dollhouse&quot;-keeper Joss Whedon has agreed to direct one of the back nine episodes that Fox just ordered. Turns out, the genius who gave us not only the &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; musical episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; but also &quot;Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog&quot; is a big fan of Ryan Murphy's new phenom.So when Twentieth (the studio behind &quot;Glee&quot;) approached him about the gig, pretty much his only reservation was scheduling. EW.com: &quot;Glee&quot;: Where you've seen the cast before &quot;Joss directed one of the great musical episodes in the history of television on 'Buffy,' &quot; gushed Murphy, &quot;so this is a great, if unexpected, fit. I'm thrilled he'll be loaning us his fantastic groundbreaking talent.&quot;And there's no reason to panic, &quot;Dollhouse&quot; fans: I'm told the auteur's moonlighting in no way, shape or form suggests that that show is a goner. He'd most likely tackle the side job after Eliza Dushku and Co. have wrapped their 13-episode order.
