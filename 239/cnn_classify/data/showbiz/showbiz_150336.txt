^_^Title^_^'New Moon' sets midnight showing record^_^Story^_^The second installment in the &quot;Twilight&quot; saga, starring Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, Kristen Stewart as his star-crossed love and Taylor Lautner as the wolfboy who loves her, has already ripped through a box office record.According to Hollywood trade magazine Variety, &quot;New Moon&quot; is the biggest midnight showing in history, grossing $26.3 million when it opened in 3,514 theaters at 12:01 a.m. Friday.The film even surpassed the supernatural cinema force that is &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; collecting more than the $22.2 million that &quot;Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince&quot; earned during its midnight showing this summer.&quot;New Moon&quot; has also easily beaten its own predecessor, &quot;Twilight,&quot; which earned $36 million on opening day last year. And while &quot;Twilight's&quot; opening weekend was $69.7 million, early reports are that &quot;New Moon&quot; will do even better.But along with the ticket sales bounty is backlash. The Vatican released an announcement Friday denouncing the film, which is based on Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster series. &quot;This film is nothing more than a moral vacuum with a deviant message and as such should be of concern,&quot; warns the Vatican's culture council leader, Monsignor Franco Perazzolo, in a statement timed to the release of &quot;New Moon,&quot; according to E! Online.&quot;This theme of vampires in 'Twilight' combines a mixture of excesses,&quot; he continued, &quot;that, as ever, is aimed at young people and gives a heavy esoteric element.&quot;Yet the kids these days appear to dig the &quot;excesses&quot; of &quot;Twilight.&quot; Still, only time will tell if &quot;New Moon&quot; will also outsell the current &quot;best opening day&quot; titleholder, &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; which grossed $67.2 million when it opened July 18, 2008.Loading weather data ...
