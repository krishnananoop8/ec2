^_^Title^_^'Star Wars' creator launches youth film project^_^Story^_^London, England Film royalty shook hands with British royalty at the launch of &quot;Films Without Borders&quot; -- a new scheme that aims to use the language of cinema to break down cultural barriers among young people from diverse backgrounds.Director George Lucas was among a host of industry insiders invited by Prince Edward, third son of Queen Elizabeth, to the glitzy event held at Buckingham Palace, London -- the Queen's official residence.But it wasn't just film professionals and high society bigwigs that enjoyed a rare public appearance from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator.Israeli former soldier Omri Bezalel, Palestinian refugee Ismal Al Quaisi, and Pierre Kayitana -- an exile from the Rwandan genocide -- were treated to a one-on-one masterclass with the pioneering film legend.At a production studio in London's Piccadilly Circus, the three aspiring young filmmakers quizzed Lucas, dressed casually in jeans and a striped shirt, about the secrets of his craft.Kayitana, 24, who had traveled all the way from Rwanda specifically for the event, was keen to talk about borders -- not those that divide nations and cultures, however, but the ones that separate aspiring filmmakers from the industry itself.&quot;After school, there is still this border. It is too hard for a young filmmaker to meet with a great, established industry person&quot; he told Lucas.But Kayitana should consider himself lucky, said Lucas, who is also the brains behind &quot;Raiders of the Lost Arc.&quot; &quot;That border has always been there. When I was a student there was no way to get into the film business.&quot;You're in a great position because you're in a country where you're starting out in a whole new film industry.&quot;Young Palestinian Quaisi cut straight to the tricks of the trade: &quot;What is the best way to create special effects?&quot; he asked.&quot;All the special effects we use now are on our computers&quot; replied Lucas, who said that you no longer need a lot of sophisticated equipment to produce a good film. &quot;The thing you have to deal with is just learning the craft -- but this is not out of reach.&quot;Israeli-born Bezalel told CNN that although he was fortunate enough to study film in New York, nothing beats speaking directly with one of the industry's true greats: &quot;You learn more from talking with a person for an hour than you can in film school,&quot; he said.The 26-year-old presented the director with his concern that, after years of inventive movie-making, there's a sense that everything has already been done.&quot;People have been telling stories for 10,000 years&quot; said Lucas. &quot;There are only 32 kinds of story. So, don't think you're going to tell a new story -- the only thing that changes is the way you tell the story.&quot;So, &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the 1977 sci-fi that made Lucas' name isn't an original masterpiece? &quot;'Star Wars' is a mish-mash of a lot of things which have already been done,&quot; said Lucas. &quot;I know that it's not a new story, but nobody ever did it that way before. Nobody had ever taken it in that direction, using the tools and metaphors I used.&quot;So don't worry about being original -- only be original in the way you do it.&quot;Speaking to CNN, the filmmaker laid out his vision for the future of cinema.&quot;Literally all of the borders are going to fall down,&quot; he said of the democratizing influence of technology. &quot;You can buy the cameras. You can buy the editing equipment. You can buy the special effects. Everything you need to make a movie, you can get for a very very low price. Twenty years ago, that would have cost you a million dollars,&quot; he said.Lucas told CNN that, by harnessing the Internet, filmmakers of the future will be free from the controlling influence of major film distribution companies.But how will young up-and-comers finance such projects? On this final point, the reclusive director was a little more ambiguous: &quot;You can probably make a living at it ... at some point.&quot;Loading weather data ...
