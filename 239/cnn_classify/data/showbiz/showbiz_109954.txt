^_^Title^_^Hitchcock classics get a remake -- in sticky tape^_^Story^_^London, England Philadelphia-based artist Mark Khaisman has proved you don't need suitcases of cash for successful movie remakes -- he simply raided the stationery cupboard.Using packing tape, he has recreated scenes from favorite Alfred Hitchcock thrillers &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; and &quot;Spellbound.&quot;  His novel use of the stationery more commonly associated with securing parcels also extends to reworking stills from late director Samuel Fuller's 1953 noir masterpiece &quot;Pickup on South Street.&quot;The medium may be banal, but Khaisman's tape art is anything but everyday.To get the striking effect, Khaisman applies translucent brown packing tape to clear plastic panels. By building up layers, he can create opaque areas, which block out light shining through the back of the panels.The Ukrainian former stained-glass designer says he hopes his tape art makes looking at cultural icons a more personal experience.
