^_^Title^_^Brooke Mueller released from hospital ^_^Story^_^Los Angeles, California Brooke Mueller checked out of a Los Angeles hospital Tuesday, a week after she was admitted for treatment of pneumonia, her lawyer said.&quot;She was released and is doing OK,&quot; Yale Galanter said.When Mueller -- wife of actor Charlie Sheen -- was taken to Sherman Oaks Hospital last week, her temperature was 105 degrees and she had infection in both lungs, Galanter said.Her illness led to a Colorado judge to temporarily lift a protective order that otherwise prevented Sheen, 44, from visiting his wife.The protective order was issued last month after the &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star was arrested on a domestic violence charge in Aspen, Colorado, on Christmas Day.Aspen police charged Sheen with felony second-degree assault, felony menacing and a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief. He was booked under his birth name, Carlos Irwin Estevez.A hearing on the domestic violence charge was delayed until February 8 because of Mueller's illness.Mueller, 32, moved out of the couple's Aspen rental home earlier this month to return to Los Angeles with their twins.CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.Loading weather data ...
