^_^Title^_^Kidman, Cruz and Loren top star-studded cast of musical 'Nine'^_^Story^_^London, England (CNN)  -- Where can you find Daniel Day-Lewis, Sophia Loren, Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Marion Cotillard, Kate Hudson and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas all having a blast singing and dancing together?In Rob Marshall's new Italy-drenched musical, &quot;Nine,&quot; opening in theatres December 18, with what has to be the most star-studded cast ever to grace a musical. The new singing-and-dancing extravaganza by the director of the Academy Award-winning &quot;Chicago&quot; is the story of Italian film director Guido Contini, played by Day-Lewis. Contini is in the throes of a mid-life crisis that has stifled his creative juices but ramped up his romantic entanglements in early 1960s Venice.Sophia Loren plays Day-Lewis' mother; Marion Cotillard his wife and the other stars his various love interests. The story is based on an adaptation of Federico Fellini's autobiographical film, &quot;8&frac12;.&quot;Asked how he persuaded so many super-star leading ladies to play supporting parts in his new film, Marshall said he was &quot;astonished&quot; that they all wanted to take part. &quot;I think it's because a musical is special, as it rarely happens,&quot; the director told CNN. &quot;And when it does, people who have a natural skill want to do it.&quot;&quot;We all knew how special it was.&quot;Marshall said that occasionally during filming, he had to &quot;pinch&quot; himself &quot;because there's Sophia Loren, Judi Dench and Daniel Day-Lewis, the greatest actors in the world. I was overwhelmed each day working with them. That never really went away.&quot;Asked how and why he came to cast Day-Lewis as the leading man in a musical, Marshall said of the actor: &quot;He likes challenges, and he wants to transform himself into parts and become people.&quot;Marshall said singing and dancing came naturally to Day-Lewis, much more known for dark, dramatic roles. &quot;We had a short amount of time once we cast him, but he just went to work and kept working on the voice, the movement.&quot;&quot;He is just a director's dream,&quot; Marshall said about the award-winning actor, &quot;because not only is he such a consummate artist and worker, but he's also wonderful to work with.&quot;Loading weather data ...
