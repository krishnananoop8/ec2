^_^Title^_^Nicolas Cage caused his own financial ills, ex-business manager says^_^Story^_^Los Angeles, California Nicolas Cage brought about his own financial ruin with a spending spree that included two castles, 15 palatial homes, a flotilla of yachts and a squadron of Rolls Royces, his former business manager said.Samuel Levin, responding to a lawsuit Cage filed against him, said he warned the Oscar-winning actor that he could face bankruptcy unless he scaled back his lavish lifestyle.Cage, one of Hollywood's highest-paid movie stars, sued Levin in October, charging that he &quot;lined his pockets with several million dollars in business management fees while sending Cage down a path toward financial ruin.&quot;&quot;Cage discovered that he is now forced to sell major assets and investments at a significant loss and is faced with huge tax liabilities because of Levin's incompetence, misrepresentations and recklessness,&quot; Cage's lawsuit said. He asked the Los Angeles Superior Court for $20 million in damages from Levin.Levin filed a counter-complaint this week demanding $129,000 owed to him by Cage for recent work on his tax returns. The filing also argued that Cage was &quot;deeply in debt&quot; when he started working for him in 2001 because Cage had &quot;already squandered tens of millions of dollars he had earned as a movie star.&quot;Levin said he warned Cage, whose given name is Nicolas Coppola, that he needed to earn $30 million a year &quot;just to maintain his lavish lifestyle.&quot; He urged Cage to save &quot;a cash cushion&quot; of at least $10 million &quot;to alleviate the financial pressure to take film roles that might be detrimental to his career,&quot; Levin's response said. Several of Cage's recent movie roles have been seen by critics as &quot;paycheck gigs&quot; taken only because of his pressing debt.Levin's filing claimed that starting in 2005 and then &quot;with increasing urgency&quot; over the next two years, he &quot;implored Coppola to stop buying real estate and urged him to reduce his real estate holdings, warning Coppola that the financial press was filled with references to a 'real estate bubble.' &quot;He countered Cage's claim that the actor was left in the dark about his finances.&quot;Levin repeatedly warned Coppola that he was living beyond his means, urged him to spend less, and warned him that financial disaster loomed if he continued to spend uncontrollably,&quot; Levin's filing said.&quot;Levin described the folly of several other well-known entertainers who compulsively overspent their way into bankruptcy, and warned Coppola 'it could happen to you,' &quot; the filing said.Cage should have known about his debt because &quot;he signed every check for every monetary transaction throughout the relationship,&quot; Levin said.&quot;Instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Coppola spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences, most of which were bought against Levin's advice,&quot; Levin's complaint said. &quot;Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art.&quot;Cage's four yachts included one each for the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Newport Beach, California, and Rhode Island, Levin said.In 2007 alone, Cage's &quot;shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items,&quot; Levin's filing said.&quot;Coppola also spent huge sums taking his sizable entourage on costly vacations and threw enormous, Gatsby-style parties at his residences,&quot; it said.Levin's warnings that Cage was living beyond his means were not just ignored, but &quot;at times Levin was rebuked for trying to restrain the outflow of cash,&quot; he said.&quot;The pinnacle&quot; of Cage's spending spree was the purchase of two castles -- in England and Germany -- which Levin warned &quot;were decrepit and needed huge expenditures,&quot; he said.Cage's financial collapse came in 2008 when real estate values plunged and most of his residences turned &quot;upside down, just as the global credit crunch made it impossible to cover Coppola's endless cash calls by borrowing more money,&quot; Levin said. The case of Nicolas Cage versus Samuel Levin is set for a hearing in a Beverly Hills, California, courtroom on February 3, 2010, according to court records.Loading weather data ...
