^_^Title^_^America's best North-South roads^_^Story^_^(Lonely Planet) -- Go west, young man! This historic cliché still resonates when it comes to road trips. But whether it's bombing to the Bay Area along the often dull-as-dirt I-80 or trying to find traces of iconic Route 66 amid a tangle of bland Interstates, the old paradigm of thinking horizontal when planning a road trip is simply not the way to go.Many of the best and most interesting roads in the U.S. run north to south, crossing the nation's striations and taking you from northern weather and cultures to entirely different ones down south. As a bonus these roads pack a lot into routes that are often shorter than the east-west standbys. New York to San Francisco is about 2900 miles by the most direct route, snoozy I-80. But Chicago to Miami on the legendary US 41 through Nashville is only 1400 miles and a thrilling journey from start to finish.Often overlooked, the old national highways (with route numbers proceeded by 'US') offer some incredible north-south journeys. At times the routes disappear under modern interstates but these are mere interruptions in authentic journeys of discovery and adventure. Here are some favorites.Lonely Planet: How to survive a boring road tripSummer Travel: 10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S.Lonely Planet: The planet's ultimate drivesSummer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf CoastLonely Planet: Top 10 places to view the golden gate bridgeOriginally published as "America's Best North-South Roads" © 2012 Lonely Planet.
