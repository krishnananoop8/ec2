During the time he lived in the home with his family, he worked on many of his best known manuscripts, including &quot;To Have or Have Not.&quot; About 70 percent of Hemingway's work was done while he lived in the home, according to Gonzales. In Hemingway's lifetime, he completed some 14 novels and about 50 short stories, Gonzales said. The home became a museum in 1964 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968.
