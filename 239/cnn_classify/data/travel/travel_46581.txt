Privacy, of course, is a must.A-listers can also afford the best of the best, so they expect royal treatment -- and they get it.When five-star hotels know they have celebrities in-house, they do everything they possibly can to accommodate them, including indulging any special requests, said Jacqueline Gifford, travel editor for Brides Magazine.But the great service and hospitality at these places isn't limited to just bold-faced names.&quot;When you're paying that much money to stay at a fabulous place, they're going to go over the top to pamper you, whether you're a celebrity or not,&quot; Gifford said.With that in mind, here are seven resorts used to catering to famous guests:North Island, SeychellesWith its exotic location in the Indian Ocean, lush tropical beauty and a secluded beach, no wonder Britain's Prince William and his bride, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, chose this resort for their honeymoon spot in the spring.The island is home to 11 guest villas that &quot;blend seamlessly&quot; with their surroundings and are &quot;designed to celebrate nature,&quot; the resort says, touting its eco-friendly philosophy.Guests share the retreat with tortoises and endangered species of birds, such as the Black Paradise Flycatcher and the Seychelles Magpie Robin. You might also get a peek at the coco-de-mer palm, which produces the largest seeds in the plant kingdom.It's this combination of beauty and privacy that draws celebrities.David and Victoria Beckham celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on the island in 2009.
