Amir Khan is still only 23, but is quickly making a name for himself in world boxing. An Olympic medal winner when he was just 17-years-old, Khan recently boxed his first bout in the U.S. defeating Pauli Malignaggi in New York in May, retaining his WBA World Light Welterweight belt. As a young British Muslim of Pakistani heritage, Khan has also become something of a poster boy for multiculturalism in the UK. While he enthusiastically embraces his task as a role model for young people, he is as dedicated to his craft as he is to his faith. &quot;I think having that religion and faith takes you to a different level, totally,&quot; he said. &quot;I love being a role model and being this young, British Muslim fighter. It's a good title for me.&quot; His personal goal to becoming one of the greatest ever boxers is perhaps just as large as his task in dismissing negative stereotypes of Muslims. &quot;With the terrorist [attacks] since 9/11 the Muslims need people like me to say 'look we're not all like this' and there are a lot more good Muslims in the world than bad. That's what I like to promote.&quot; Click through the photo gallery, above, to learn more about the rising star of the ring, and click here to read more from Amir about his life in the ring and in the spotlight.
