^_^Title^_^Replay 'fairest solution' says Henry^_^Story^_^(CNN)  -- Thierry Henry believes a replay would be the &quot;fairest solution&quot; after his handball set up France's clinching goal in their World Cup playoff with the Republic of Ireland.As the controversy showed no signs of abating on Friday, Henry released a statement to news organizations in which he claimed again that he was not a cheat and that his handball had been an &quot;instinctive reaction.&quot;Earlier on Friday, world governing body FIFA denied a request by the Irish Football Federation (FAI) to replay the game, a reality touched upon by Henry in his statement.&quot;The fairest solution would be to replay the game but it is not in my control,&quot; said the Barcelona striker.&quot;Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa,&quot; Henry added.&quot;I have said at the time and I will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area.Henry, who touched the ball twice with his hand before crossing for William Gallas to score France's equalizer, putting them 2-1 ahead on aggregate, claimed television technology had made the incident look worse.&quot;As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times to be able to make a conscious decision. &quot;People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.&quot;Henry's former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports News that the the French federation should offer for the game to be replayed.&quot;For the sense of justice it is quite embarrassing to see,&quot; he said. &quot;I think even France is embarrassed. &quot;We didn't play well at all and we won the game and won the qualification with a goal that was not a goal.&quot;But former Ireland captain Roy Keane took the opposite view in an astonishing broadside aimed at leading officials at the FAI, accusing them of hypocrisy and telling them to &quot;get over it.&quot;Keane told gathered reporters: &quot;Ireland had their chances in the two games (against France), and they never took them. &quot;But it's the usual FAI reaction -- 'we've been robbed, the honesty of the game.&quot;Keane went on to put the blame on the Irish defense for the controversial winning goal.&quot;I'd focus on why they didn't clear it,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd be more annoyed with my defenders and my goalkeeper than Thierry Henry. How can you let the ball bounce in your six-yard box?&quot;How can you let Thierry Henry get goal-side of you? &quot;If the ball goes into the six-yard box, where the hell is my goalkeeper?&quot;Loading weather data ...
