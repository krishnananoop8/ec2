^_^Title^_^Khan and Peterson set for immediate rematch^_^Story^_^The World Boxing Association (WBA) ordered a rematch Friday of last month's world title fight between Britain's Amir Khan and American Lamont Peterson, according to Khan's representatives.Khan lost both his WBA and International Boxing Federation (IBF) light-welterweight belts on a split decision in the December 10 bout in Washington, having received points deductions in the seventh and 12th rounds for repeated pushing.The WBA's announcement comes after video footage emerged showing unauthorized individual Mustafa Ameen talking with a judge and appearing to handle official scoring cards.A statement on Khan's website also said referee Joseph Cooper failed to credit the 25-year-old with a knockdown and claimed the fight in Peterson's home state of Maryland contained "a plethora of anomalies."Peterson does have the option of refusing the rematch, which must take place within 180 days, but it would mean the 27-year-old relinquishing the WBA title he won in the unification bout."After a sound and fair analysis of the facts contained in the appeal filed by Golden Boy Promotions on behalf of Amir Khan with respect to the outcome of the WBA and IBF world title fight between Khan and Lamont Peterson, the WBA has ordered that an immediate rematch take place within 180 days," read the statement."The WBA also pointed to Mr. Ameen's apparent intrusion into the scoring process as well as possible discrepancies between the score sheets of the two sanctioning organizations and the local athletic commission."The WBA went out of its way to note that under normal circumstances it would not disturb the discretionary function of a referee, however, in this case, because of the multiple irregularities, it was necessary for it to order the rematch."Former Olympic silver medalist Khan is itching for a rematch to get his career back on track. There had been talk of him taking on Floyd Mayweather Jr. later this year."I'm pleased that justice has been done and the WBA has ordered an immediate rematch. All we ask as sportsmen is for a fair and level playing field when we compete," Khan said."Lamont Peterson proved in our fight that he is a great competitor and I hope that a second bout will be just as exciting. I want to prove without doubt that I'm the best in the 140lb division by taking care of business in the rematch."Khan's professional record currently stands at 26 wins, 18 by knockout, and two defeats in 28 fights. Peterson has lost just one of his 32 fights, winning 30, 15 by knockout, and drawing one.Loading weather data ...
