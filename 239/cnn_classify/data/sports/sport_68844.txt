^_^Title^_^Klitschko defends WBC title with points win over Chisora ^_^Story^_^Vitali Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title with a unanimous points victory over British challenger Dereck Chisora in Munich.The 40-year-old Ukrainian secured his tenth straight title defense and took his record to 44 wins from 46 fights, but he failed to knock out his brave opponent.The judges scored the bout 119-111, 118-110 and 118-110 in favor of Klitschko, who later looked on as Chisora and former WBA heavyweight champion David Haye became embroiled at a scuffle at the post fight press conference.Chisora, with 17 professional fights under his belt before Saturday's contest in Germany, came in as the underdog and under a cloud after slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in on Friday.Chisora threatens to shoot Haye in press conference brawlKlitschko vowed revenge, and Chisora further antagonized his opponent when he spat water in the face of Vitali's brother, Wladimir, the current WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight champion.But when the bell rang, Chisora took the fight to Klitschko and dominated the early exchanges without landing any significant blows.Klitschko began to find his range in the second round, making his mark with a left-right combination and stepped things up in the next two, as he forced blood from Chisora's nose and mouth.Both landed strong punches in round seven before the pair began to tire as it became evident the fight would go the full 12 rounds. Klitschko bossed the later exchanges, but Chisora never stopped coming at his opponent.After the fight Klitschko told reporters: "I have got respect for Chisora as a fighter but no respect as a human being. He was not fair."I was a bit upset after because I didn't knock him out. I don't want to make excuses but it's true I fought for almost eight rounds with just my right hand and no left. My left hand is key for any of my fights and for the knockout."I really wanted to knock him out after he slapped me at the weigh-in but it didn't happen."Chisora, who was scheduled to fight Vitali twice previously before the Ukrainian pulled out with injury, told the host broadcaster he was proud of his performance."I got beat by experience, but he did not hurt me. I gave a great fight," he said.Loading weather data ...
