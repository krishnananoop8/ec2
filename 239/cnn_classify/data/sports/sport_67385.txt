^_^Title^_^Ricker wins Canada's second gold as Jacobellis suffers again^_^Story^_^Maelle Ricker handed hosts Canada a second gold medal of the 2010 Winter Olympics on a day that saw her snowboarding category delayed due to bad weather and a men's alpine skiing event postponed.Too much snow overnight at Whistler meant more changes to the men's skiing program on Tuesday, with the super combined event now to be held on a day yet to be announced, while the women's snowboard cross qualifiers were delayed by two hours due to fog on Cypress Mountain.Ricker bounced back from a fall in her first heat to qualify from the first round in third place, and then was top in her quarterfinal and semifinal before heading off France's Deborah Anthonioz in the four-woman final, while Olivia Nobs of Switzerland took the bronze.The 31-year-old Ricker was third at the 2005 world championships but missed out on a medal at the Turin Winter Games the following year, when American Lindsey Jacobellis famously fell while leading the final.Jacobellis, the 2006 silver medallist and two-time world champion, started well on Tuesday as she qualified second and then won her quarterfinal. But disaster struck in the semis as she hit the outside of a gate and finished last, before regaining a measure of respect by winning the minor final.Speed skatingLee Sang-Hwa of South Korea won the gold in the ladies' 500M speed skating competition, edging out Jenny Wolf of Germany by .05 of a second with a combined time of 76.09 for the two races.Wang Beixing of China took the bronze with 76.63, just over half a second behind Lee.LugeTatjana Huefner of Germany claimed the gold in the women's singles luge with a combined time for the four runs of 2 minutes 46.524 seconds. Nina Reithmayer of Austria broke a German sweep, coming in .490 seconds behind Huefner, winning the silver.Natalie Geisenberger of Germany was .577 seconds behind Huefner and took the bronze.The mood was somber, as the track was where Georgian Nodar Kumaritashvili had died while on a training run hours before the Olympic Opening Ceremony.Alpine skiingAmerican skiing star Bode Miller will have to wait for the chance to win his first super combined gold medal after Tuesday's two planned runs in Whistler were postponed.The 32-year-old, who claimed his third Olympic medal with bronze in the blue riband alpine downhill race on Monday, had been set to compete in the dual-discipline event's downhill in the morning and slalom in the afternoon but there was too much snow overnight.Weather has been a problem for the skiing program since the opening day, with the alpine downhill switched from Saturday due to unsuitably warm conditions.Miller was second in the combined category at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, where he also won silver in the giant slalom.Switzerland's Didier Defoga, who won a shock gold on Monday, and silver medallist Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway are also in the field along with America's 2006 champion Ted Ligety and runner-up Ivica Costelic of Croatia.The postponement could mean that Friday's Super G event and Sunday's giant slalom have to be rescheduled. Officials said that the new time and date for the super combined event would be announced later on Tuesday.But the women's downhill race on Wednesday is not in doubt, organizers said, despite Tuesday's training session also being canceled.The race, which features U.S. gold medal hope Lindsey Vonn, had originally been scheduled for last Sunday but also had to be switched due to unsuitable conditions.BiathlonThe biathlon program was unaffected, however, with Germany's Magdalena Neuner taking revenge on Anastazia Kuzmina to win the women's 10-kilometer pursuit title.Kuzmina claimed a surprise gold in Saturday's 7.5 kilometer sprint event, the first Winter Olympic medal of any kind by a Slovakian, as 2007 sprint and pursuit world champion Neuner finished with a silver.That victory gave Kuzmina the right to lead off the staggered start to the event, which combines cross-country skiing with standing and prone rifle-shooting, but the 23-year-old Neuner finished 12.3 seconds ahead of her in a time of 30:16.0.Kuzmina was another 16 seconds ahead of bronze medal winner Marie Laure Brunet of France.Curling Defending men's champions Canada scraped a 7-6 victory against Norway in their opening round-robin match on the ice at at Vancouver Olympic Center, needing an extra end to edge ahead after the Scandinavians leveled with two points at the 10th.World champions Great Britain crashed to a 6-4 defeat against European champions Sweden, who led 2-1 after three ends and stayed ahead despite conceding a pair at the ninth. The United States were beaten 7-5 by an experienced Germany team, while Switzerland edged Denmark 6-5 thanks mainly to a four at the seventh end.The women's curling competition was to start later on Tuesday, and after that the men will play their second of nine round-robin matches.Loading weather data ...
