I played very solid in my front-nine and made four in a row in the back-nine to give myself a nice solid lead going into the last two holes."Jonathan Moore of the U.S. finished with a 61 to secure his second runner-up finish of the season with Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee in third.Loading weather data ...
