^_^Title^_^Veteran Singh upstages McIlroy and Woods to hold slender lead at BMW^_^Story^_^Vijay Singh gave a timely reminder of his enduring ability by grabbing the halfway lead in the BMW Championship at Crooked Stick Friday.The 49-year-old Fijian carded a six-under 66 to back up his opening 65 for a two round total of 13-under 131.It left him one shot ahead of the star pairing of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Ryan Moore also in the chasing group after a second straight 66.Singh has made fast starts to both the PGA Championship, won by McIlroy, and The Barclays, but each times has faded badly at the weekend.He is determined not to stage a repeat as he bids to emulate his 2008 triumph in the FedExCup playoffs."I've to keep it going," Singh told the official PGA Tour website."I've been playing well for two days for a while now, but I need four days of good playing."Sooner or later, I think four days is going to happen, and hopefully it starts this week."But a clutch of leading players are within striking distance as World No.1 McIlroy and Woods could not be separated at the end of the second round.Both finished with closing birdies on the par-five 18th to reach 12 under, Woods finishing strongly with three birdies on the final four holes.McIlroy, who eagled the par-5 ninth as he got to 13-under, battled wayward tee shots on the back nine on his way to a 68.The pair were set to play together for a third straight day, but an inclement weather forecast has meant organizers will be sending out the field early in groups of three.Former World No.1 Lee Westwood made the biggest move of the day, tapping in from 17 inches on the final hole for a birdie to card a 65 and move to 11-under, the same mark as Bo Van Pelt.Phil Mickelson showed improved form with a 67 for eight-under 136, but joint first round leader Webb Simpson, the U.S. Open champion, slumped to a 75 to fall back to five-under.With the course still soft and receptive to scoring only nine players from the 70-strong elite field were over par at the halfway mark.There is no cut at the tournament, the third leg of the lucrative FedExCup play offs, but only the top 30 in the rankings advance to the Tour Championship in Atlanta in two weeks time.On the European Tour, England's Graeme Storm lead at the halfway stage of the KLM Open at Hilversum Friday, carding a second round 66. He opened with a superb 63 in the Netherlands.He has a three shot advantage over Scott Jamieson, Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and Peter Hanson, who is one of three European Ryder Cup players in the field.Wild card pick Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium shot 65 to reach five under, while Germany's Martin Kaymer is a shot further back.They will all be hoping to maintain that form ahead of the match against the United States at Medinah in Chicago at the end of the month.Loading weather data ...
