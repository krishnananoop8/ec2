^_^Title^_^Djokovic sets sights on Paris party after Australia triumph^_^Story^_^Novak Djokovic might have become the first man to win three consecutive Australian Open titles in 46 years, but the World No.1 is already targeting the only grand slam to have got away.Djokovic produced a dazzling display to come from behind and defeat Andy Murray 6-7 7-6 6-3 6-2 in Melbourne Sunday to claim a sixth grand slam title.The Serbian, who defeated Murray in the final in Melbourne two years ago, has already won at Wimbledon and at the U.S. Open, but it's the clay courts of Paris which have not yet witnessed a Djokovic triumph.Visualizing greatness: How Novak Djokovic rose to the topBut with seven-time winner and clay court king Rafael Nadal still struggling to prove his fitness, Djokovic is setting his sights on lifting the famous Coupe de Mousquetaires for the very first time in the French capital this May."Of course, I want to go all the way in French Open," said Djokovic, who was beaten by Nadal in last year's final in Paris."I went to the finals last year and had a great match against Rafa, but he's always the favorite on that surface and he's the ultimate player to beat on clay."But I think if I continue on playing well, stay healthy, I can have a chance."While Djokovic is already looking towards future success, his latest triumph came following a titanic tussle against the man who had beaten him at last year's U.S. Open final.Murray, fresh from winning Olympic gold and claiming his maiden grand slam victory at Flushing Meadows, had hoped to become the first man in the modern era to win his second major championship immediately after his first.The world No.3, who overcame Roger Federer in the semifinals, took the first set on the tiebreak, but faded after his failure to convert three break points at the start of the second.Both men served well with over two hours and 52 minutes of action passing before a break point was finally converted as Djokovic struck.With the Serb 4-3 ahead in the second set, Murray faltered on his serve, allowing Djokovic to break with a powerful forehand into the corner.It was a pivotal moment with Djokovic going on to win eight of the following nine games, while Murray began to wilt under the pain of pressure and exhaustion.Azarenka beats unlucky Li to retain Australian Open crownIn the end, Djokovic cruised home to make it six grand slam titles and move level with the likes of Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Don Budge and Jack Crawford in the all-time list."I knew it was going to be physically demanding," he told reporters."So I needed to hang in there. "There were a few turning points in the match. Maybe one of them was the second game of the second set when I was 0-40 against the breeze."He missed a few shots and I managed to get a crucial hold. After that I felt mentally a little bit lighter and more confident on the court than I had done in the first hour or so."I went for my shots in the third and fourth and came to the net quite often."I needed to be the one who dictated the play and I'm really glad that I played my best."Murray, who was aiming to win his second grand slam title following his win over Djokovic at last year's U.S. Open, looked to be struggling physically following his grueling semifinal win over Roger Federer.Murray required a medical time out at the conclusion of the third set to treat a nasty looking blister, but the Briton refused to blame the injury for his defeat.He told reporters: "It's just a pretty large blister. You get them -- it happens."It was just a bit sore when I was running around. It's not like pulling a calf muscle or something."It just hurts when you run, but it's not something which stops you from playing."Ninety per cent of the players on tour will have played this tournament with some sort of blister or problem."It had no bearing on the result."Loading weather data ...
