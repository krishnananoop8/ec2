You know, despite the fact that she might not be seeded high or didn't play for a little bit, she's still a very experienced player and a tremendous athlete.

It's not about for me I have to play perfect every match. I don't have that mentality.""I know I'm not the highest seed, so I realize I'm probably going to have to play someone and someone is going to have to play me.
