^_^Title^_^She acts in faith. Who deserves hers?^_^Story^_^Mary Roberts gingerly slides behind the wheel of her husband's white Cadillac with its distinctive green ragtop and Catholic Radio bumper sticker. At 67, she's been widowed nine years and is retired after working nearly three decades as a high school guidance counselor. But her life is far from empty.Roberts heads back home to pick up her son. Terron is unemployed.  He had a career as a highly skilled Navy corpsman during the Gulf War, until a fire erupted on his ship.  Rushing to help fight it, he fell down a steep ladder. He survived with an injured shoulder and knee. But he found a bunkmate dead in his bed.Twice a week, Roberts volunteers at a food pantry inside a community center operated by her church. It serves the Old Oaks Historic District, where most residents live below the poverty line. Education and determination, Roberts says, were the key to her large family's success.  All of her 10 siblings went to college. Roberts earned a master's degree.&ldquo;I want a president with courage to bring people together.  Real courage to act.&rdquo;Roberts sits with her hands folded in a room in the church rectory. Only about a dozen parishioners attend daily Mass, so Father Joshua Wagner moved the congregation from their large Gothic church to this simple place of worship.Loading weather data ...
