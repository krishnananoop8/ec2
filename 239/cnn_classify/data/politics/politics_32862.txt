^_^Title^_^Retiring senators: Time is ripe for bipartisanship^_^Story^_^Washington Three longtime senators who have decided not to seek re-election in 2012 said Sunday that they believe the country is ready for serious bipartisan cooperation on major issues -- especially tackling the massive national debt.&quot;When we begin to act in that way, working across party lines ... then it not only gets things done, but it increases the characteristic American optimism and confidence,&quot; independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, told ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; &quot;To raise the GDP, I've been saying, we've got to raise the GDC, the gross domestic confidence.&quot;Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, joined Lieberman in rejecting suggestions that their departures indicate that taking some centrist or moderate positions or reaching across the aisle can be politically disastrous.Lieberman, a former Democrat who supported Republican Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election, acknowledged that he would have faced a challenge holding onto his seat in 2012.&quot;I believed I would have won re-election,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously, it would have been a tough campaign. But, you know, as I said, so what else is new? I've run -- almost all my campaigns have been tough. That's not the reason why I didn't run. I didn't run because I want to try something different.&quot;Lieberman did not specify what will be his next venture.Hutchison, who described herself as a &quot;reliable conservative,&quot; faced a challenge from the tea party movement if she had sought re-election. She acknowledged Sunday that &quot;there are people who think that maybe I fought too hard for Texas in spending areas.&quot; &quot;I mean, I read the blogs, and it gets kind of depressing, frankly, to read those blogs,&quot; she said. But she insisted she had support from tea party leaders, and said &quot;the tea party has done a good thing in awakening America to the problems that we are facing and saying we can do something about it. And I appreciate that.&quot;Hutchison similarly said she believes &quot;that, if I had run, I would have won. It would have been a tough race, for sure, but I think I would have won, because I think my record is good, and it is to be effective and get things done.&quot;She decided not to run again for personal reasons, Hutchison added. &quot;I commute every week. I have two young children. And the time was right for me.&quot;Conrad, meanwhile, called for Democrats and Republicans to come together and take strong steps to change the U.S. economy. Part of the fiscal commission that proposed reducing U.S. debt by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, Conrad said leaders need to lay out the cold, hard facts clearly for the country.&quot;The American people say, 'Don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense.' That's 84% of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84% of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16% of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend,&quot; Conrad said.&quot;So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and thatit's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way.&quot;Hutchison suggested that some key measures to cut federal spending will be passed soon. &quot;I think we're going to have to be doing a lot more of that in the next few weeks,&quot; she said, &quot;because we all agree.&quot;Loading weather data ...
