^_^Title^_^Pelosi dismisses reports of tension with White House^_^Story^_^Washington House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday downplayed recent reports of a strained relationship between congressional Democrats and the White House, telling reporters the administration has been &quot;cooperative&quot; in the run-up to this November's midterm elections. &quot;We had a very positive meeting with the president yesterday,&quot; Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. &quot;There is absolutely no reason to think that the White House has been anything but cooperative with us&quot; in efforts to maintain a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. &quot;I have nothing but praise&quot; for administration efforts, Pelosi said. There is &quot;no better leader or advocate for America's working families&quot; than President Barack Obama.Pelosi was reportedly angered when White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that &quot;there's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control&quot; of the House. Gibbs has since clarified his remarks, saying he believes Democrats will maintain a majority in both the House and the Senate. He also has praised Pelosi for doing a &quot;monumental&quot; job over the last 18 months and insisted he has a &quot;cordial&quot; relationship with the speaker.Gibbs' comment Sunday &quot;was unfortunate,&quot; Pelosi said. But it could be &quot;interpreted many ways.&quot; It was, in certain respects, a political &quot;Rorschach test.&quot;Pelosi said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had assembled a &quot;solid organization&quot; heading into the fall campaign.CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.Loading weather data ...
