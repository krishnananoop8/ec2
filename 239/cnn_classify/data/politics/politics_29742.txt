^_^Title^_^Measuring the impact of spending cuts^_^Story^_^Congress passed a continuing resolution Thursday, March 21, ending the most recent threat of a government shutdown. Part of the measure eased the pain of $85 billion in forced spending giving agencies a bit more discretion in where the cuts fall. Other forced governmental spending cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect on March 2. In most areas, the impact has not been sudden. Most cuts will take effect incrementally and will be felt over time. The table below tracks major areas of the federal government where an impact has been projected and what has actually happened. It is organized by agency and category. You can sort each column or search for specific information, such as "TSA" or "food safety." Data updated: April 9, 2013 Loading weather data ...
