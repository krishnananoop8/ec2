Clinton reiterated those concerns in a dinner meeting with Karzai on the eve of his inauguration and encouraged him to seize the &quot;clear window of opportunity&quot; before him at a &quot;critical moment&quot; in Afghanistan's history.Ahead of speaking to the troops, Clinton attended a Thursday briefing with those involved in development work in Afghanistan.Personnel from the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, as well as members of provisional reconstruction teams and military commanders, were present.Loading weather data ...
