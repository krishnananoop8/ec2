^_^Title^_^Mood Map: How the results are calculated^_^Story^_^The CNN economic mood map gives you a chance to share sentiment about the economic climate in your county. You can then compare them with CNN.com users all over the world.The four questions you answer each have four multiple choice answers, representing sentiments from positive to negative. Once submitted, we compile all the answers and color the world map, based on an average of the responses for each country. So if 50% of respondents were very positive and 50% very negative, the country in question would be colored from the center of the scale. We also show how many people have responded in each country.This is not a scientific poll. The results only indicate the sentiments felt by CNN.com users and may not reflect public opinion.The CNN economic mood map can be found here.Loading weather data ...
