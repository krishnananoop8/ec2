^_^Title^_^The 25 worst passwords of 2012^_^Story^_^(TIME) -- If any of your passwords are on this list, then shame on you -- and go change them now.SplashData, which makes password management applications, has released its annual "Worst Passwords" list compiled from common passwords that are posted by hackers. The top three -- "password," "123456," and "12345678? -- have not changed since last year. New ones include "jesus," "ninja," "mustang," "password1," and "welcome." Other passwords have moved up and down on the list.The most surprising addition is probably "welcome.""That means people are not even changing default passwords," CEO Morgan Slain told TIME Tech. "It doesn't take that much time to make a new password."You should have different passwords for all of your accounts. To make it easier to remember them all, Slain suggests thinking about passwords as "passphrases." For instance, use a phrase like "dog eats bone" and add underscores, dashes, hyphens, and other punctuation marks to satisfy the special character requirement: "dog_eats_bone!"(MORE: Two Minute Video: How to Create Strong Online Passwords)Here's the full list:1. password2, 1234563. 123456784. abc1235. qwerty6. monkey7. letmein8. dragon9. 11111110. baseball11. iloveyou12. trustno113. 123456714. sunshine15. master16. 12312317. welcome18. shadow19. ashley20. football21. jesus22. michael23. ninja24. mustang25. password1MORE: The Username/Password System Is Broken: Here Are Some Ideas for Fixing It&copy 2012 TIME, Inc.
