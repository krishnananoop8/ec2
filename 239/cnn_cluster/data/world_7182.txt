^_^Title^_^Canadian's body identified in Algeria^_^Story^_^Ottawa The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday that remains found at the scene of a January terrorist attack on a natural gas facility in Algeria have been identified as those of a Canadian.The RCMP said that because an investigation is ongoing, it would not divulge any additional information.Soon after the January killings and hostage taking at the gas field, Algeria implicated two Canadians in the incident, and Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal accused one of being a ringleader.It's unclear whether the body identified by the RCMP belonged to either of those suspects, or one of the dozens of hostages killed at the gas facility, which employed many Westerners.'Mr. Marlboro': The veteran jihadist behind the attack in AlgeriaPaula Newton reported on this story from Ottawa and Mark Morgenstein wrote it in Atlanta
