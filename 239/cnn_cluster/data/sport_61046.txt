^_^Title^_^Tevez hit with massive fine after Champions League bust-up^_^Story^_^Manchester City star Carlos Tevez has been hit by a massive fine following his alleged refusal to play in their Champions League match against Bayern Munich last month.A statement by the English Premier League leaders Tuesday night said the Argentina international striker would be docked four weeks wages.Tevez was widely reported to be earning $400,000 per week, adding up to a total loss of wages of $1.6 million.He has also been given a two-week suspension, but this was deemed to have already been served.Tevez has not played for City since the September 27 bust-up in the Allianz Arena with manager Roberto Mancini.The Italian was left fuming after he claimed Tevez would not come on as a second half substitute in the 2-0 defeat to the German giants.Tevez insisted the incident was a misunderstanding, claiming he refused to warm-up because he had already done so.The stand-off between the two men has seen Tevez left to train alone and disciplinary proceedings instituted by the club.These have resulted in Tuesday's punishments as City found Tevez had breached five regulations, including "an obligation to participate in any matches in which the player is selected to play for the club when directed by a club official."Following a detailed investigation and associated hearing, a disciplinary panel has upheld the charge of misconduct," City said on their official club website."As a result Carlos Tevez has been fined four weeks' wages and has been suspended for a period of two weeks."He has received a written warning as to his future conduct."Tevez has 14 days to decide whether to lodge an appeal to the club's board of directors and has previously said he would do so.He could also take his case to the English Premier League.The Argentine striker said in the summer he wanted a move away from Eastlands, but returned for the start of the season.He may now get his wish in the January transfer window as the success of Mario Balotelli and Sergio Aguero has left him a marginalized figure at City, while Mancini said on the night of the Bayern incident that Tevez was "finished" with the club.Loading weather data ...
