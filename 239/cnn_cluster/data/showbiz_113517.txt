^_^Title^_^Your views: 'New Moon' is 'awesome'^_^Story^_^A number of CNN iReporters made sure to get in line for screenings of &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon,&quot; and their reaction can be summed up in one word: &quot;More!&quot;&quot;Grade A film! Better than the first,&quot; said frequent iReport movie reviewer Rajiim Gross of Fort Thomas, Kentucky.Gross did have one caveat: Since &quot;New Moon&quot; is the second in a series, moviegoers will have to see the first film, &quot;Twilight,&quot; to understand some of the plot developments in the second. Watch Gross' iReport IReporter Asa Thibodeax acknowledged that he wasn't a &quot;New Moon&quot; fan, but he &quot;enjoyed it,&quot; he said after a screening at the Minneapolis, Minnesota-area Mall of America. His daughter, Dacia, was more enthusiastic.&quot;I loved it -- a lot more than I thought I would,&quot; she said, adding breathily, &quot;Jacob's body,&quot; referring to star Taylor Lautner's chiseled physique.  Have your own review? Post an iReport hereLike Dacia, most &quot;New Moon&quot; fans are well familiar with the source material -- the &quot;Twilight&quot; novels by Stephenie Meyer -- and many have seen the first film plenty of times.Fifteen-year-old Annabelle Barker and 18-year-old Hilda Akinrinade, who attended a London, England, screening, couldn't wait for the new film to start.&quot;I've watched ['Twilight'] at least a hundred times!&quot; Akinrinade told CNN.Professional movie reviewers haven't been as kind to the film as fans. &quot;New Moon&quot; currently has a 29 percent approval rating at RottenTomatoes.com, the movie review aggregator site, worse than the 49 percent approval earned by &quot;Twilight.&quot;&quot;A morning-after mope-fest,&quot; wrote the Boston Globe's Ty Burr. Some moviegoers agreed. IReporter Oonabot's iReport consisted, simply, of a photograph under the headline, &quot;We went to the movies tonight.&quot; In the photo, she and her husband are wearing T-shirts that state &quot;New Moon Sucks&quot; and &quot;I [hate] Twilight.&quot;Nevertheless, most fans would not be denied. &quot;New Moon&quot; is the No. 1 film of all time in advance ticket sales, according to ticket seller MovieTickets.com. Forecasters say the film may gross as much as $100 million its opening weekend.And fans rallied around to show their support. &quot;I was blown away. It was so awesome,&quot; an unidentified female moviegoer told iReporter Chris Morrow of San Diego, California, where some fans waited for more than two hours at a Wednesday night screening.And even Anders Wright, who reviews films for San Diego's CityBeat, knows that he's outnumbered by the &quot;Twi-hards,&quot; as dedicated fans call themselves.&quot;It doesn't matter what I thought,&quot; he told Morrow. &quot;This is ultimately one of the biggest critic-proof movies of the entire year.&quot;Loading weather data ...
