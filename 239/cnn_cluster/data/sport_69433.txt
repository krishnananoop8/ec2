^_^Title^_^Scott: 'McIlroy can dominate like Tiger'^_^Story^_^Editor's note: Watch CNN Living Golf's sit down with Tiger Woods and Rory on next month's show, which premiers November 8.Arguably no man has dominated the game of golf like Tiger Woods. Majors came at an early age and followed regularly until the American's private life imploded in late 2009.And with Woods' search for majors stagnating, Rory McIlroy has been tipped to "dominate" in the way the American has done, according to Australian golfer Adam Scott.McIlroy currently sits top of the world rankings having picked up five wins this year and world No. 6 Scott says the Northern Irishman is in a league of his own on the golf circuit at the moment."He's 23, we don't have to see any improvement," Scott told CNN. "He's won two majors by eight shots, been No. 1 in the world and is starting to become a prolific winner."I think he has shown how good he is, he is the best at the moment. It is up to him how long that lasts. He has the ability to dominate fields, as Tiger did."Golf legend Jack Nicklaus suggested at a recent FedEx Cup event that Woods was intimidated by his heir apparent, leading McIlroy to quip that Tiger now referred to him as "The Intimidator".McIlroy has won two major titles at a younger age than Woods, who has risen to second in the world rankings after two years struggling with form and fitness.Woods holds the record for the number of weeks spent sitting in the No. 1 spot. The 36-year-old spent 281 consecutive weeks as the world's best golfer and he has topped the rankings for a total of 623 weeks since turning pro in 1996."It's really a matter of whether he can keep the intensity for as long as Tiger managed to," continued Scott, who narrowly missed out on a first major triumph at the 2012 British Open."That's the biggest challenge and that's something Rory has to decide for himself."Loading weather data ...
