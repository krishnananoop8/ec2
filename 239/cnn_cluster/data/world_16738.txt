Where worry had once reigned, the sound of cheerful claps floated across the rocky hillside during an emotional service.Many of the miners who attended waved or gave a quick thumbs-up to the hundreds of reporters still gathered at the San Jose mine. But few spoke.The 33 men have reportedly made a pact not to talk publicly about most of their underground ordeal -- at least not yet.&quot;There are some things that we cannot speak about because there is a pact between us,&quot; said freed miner Mario Gomez.He spoke at a neighborhood party held in his honor Saturday night.Still, he added: &quot;From the first moment, I thought they would rescue us. I never lost hope ... I never lost faith.&quot; He said the experience refocused his priorities.Read about how the miners waited for death&quot;I've been married for 32 years and rarely told my wife I loved her.
