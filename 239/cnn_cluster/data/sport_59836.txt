The agency says Armstrong, who won six Tour de France championships while with U.S. Postal, was also involved in doping.Each was given a Monday deadline to accept sanctions or contest the charges. Armstrong was granted a five-day extension.Among the charges against the two doctors and Marti was the accusation that they trafficked performance-enhancing drugs and masking agents."Permanently banning these individuals from sport is a powerful statement that protects the current and next generation of athletes from their influence, and preserves the integrity of future competition," USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a written statement.Also Tuesday, Armstrong refiled a lawsuit against USADA in a bid to halt a doping case against him. The move came one day after a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, blasted the cycling champion in a sharply worded ruling.
