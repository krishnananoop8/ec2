^_^Title^_^Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson on the mend after surgery^_^Story^_^Last we checked, Henry Cavill's the new Superman, but Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is proving to be quite the man of steel.The actor had to have an emergency hernia surgery on Monday, causing him to miss out on the Los Angeles premiere of his new movie, "Pain &amp; Gain."The day before, the star explained that he'd paid a visit to his doctor, "who had to push my intestines back thru the tear in my abdomen. Kinda romantic."But The Rock appears to be recovering well after the operation, and posted evidence to his Twitter account on Tuesday:"Surgery a success!" he tweeted, along with a photo of himself in his hospital bed, wearing a Superman T-shirt and flexing his major biceps. "Dr repaired 3 hernial tears (fun pain). Superman is on the mend ..."Johnson, who turns 41 next week, is said to be at home resting, no doubt in preparation for a busy summer. In addition to starring in Michael Bay's "Pain &amp; Gain," which arrives in theaters Friday, Johnson's also in the sixth "Fast &amp; Furious" installment, which arrives on May 24.
