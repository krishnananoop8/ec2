^_^Title^_^Bobbi Brown's beauty tips^_^Story^_^(Health.com) -- Look great with beauty pro Bobbi Brown's favorite insider tricks.Q: My mascara always clumps. What am I doing wrong?-- Danielle Hudson, Atlanta, Georgia Bobbi: Nothing at all. Sometimes too much mascara just gets on the wand. To avoid this, roll your wand against a clean paper towel before applying (avoid tissues, which have fibers that can make their way onto your eyes). Also, be sure to remove that extra glob of mascara at the end of the wand; it can cause clumping.Put on your mascara by rolling your hand up and away from your eye to help separate lashes as you go. Finish by combing a clean mascara wand through lashes.Health.com: Get longer, thicker lashesQ: My skin is so dry lately that my makeup just flakes off. Help!-- Haley Shook, Tempe, ArizonaBobbi: My derm suggested a solution and it really works: layering on moisturizers. I apply a lightweight hydrating cream, then I top it off with a thicker moisturizing balm.Lightweight lotions are water-based, so if you follow them with a thicker cream, the heavier product will help seal in the moisture from the first lotion. Revive your foundation throughout the day by dabbing on a fast-absorbing face oil.Health.com: The best humidifiers for dry skinQ: Do I need to change my makeup if I change my hair color?-- Rosa An, New York CityBobbi: For the most part, adding a few highlights or going slightly lighter or darker won't affect the colors you wear on your face because your skin tone stays the same. However, any drastic hair change may require some makeup tweaks.Going much lighter? Switch to cooler shades like light pinks on your cheeks, purples on your eyes, and pinky-reds on your lips.If you go dark, try warmer shades like rose and berry colors. If you go red, use caramel colors on your lips and eyes.Copyright Health Magazine 2011
