^_^Title^_^'Call of Duty: Black Ops' smashes one-day sales record^_^Story^_^(Wired) -- Move over, Activision. Here comes Activision.&quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; sold 5.6 million copies in 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch ever, Activision said Thursday. This breaks the previous record of 4.7 million, which Activision set last year with &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.&quot;&quot;There has never been another entertainment franchise that has set opening day records for two consecutive years,&quot; Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement.The game is also on track to outperform last year's five-day global sales record, which was $550 million, Kotick said.Activision places the total one-day sales figure at $360 million, which is an okay amount of money, I guess. It makes you wonder, though -- do 5.6 million people really care about Call of Duty, or did they all just want to play Zork?Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!
