^_^Title^_^Report: Forstall left Apple because he refused to apologize for maps^_^Story^_^(Mashable) -- Apple asked Scott Forstall to leave the company because Forstall refused to sign his name on a letter apologizing for Apple's Maps app, according to a report.Citing "people familiar with the matter," The Wall Street Journal reports that Forstall (pictured), a 15-year veteran at Apple, wanted the company to address the poor reception for Maps without apologizing. However, CEO Tim Cook disagreed and sent an e-mail to customers on Sept. 28 stating that Maps "fell short."Forstall, who oversaw Apple's mobile software unit, was one of two top execs who left Apple on Monday. The departure of the other exec, retail chief John Browett, was unrelated, according to the report.Browett, who joined Apple nine months ago from UK retailer Dixons, "failed to fit in at Apple and made some mistakes. They included the faulty implementation of a new staffing formula that cut some employee hours too severely," according to the report.The WSJ report adds that Forstall angered other Apple employees by lording his close relationship with company co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs over them and by not cooperating. For his part, Forstall was frustrated that, with Jobs gone, there was no "decider" at the company.Some members of Apple's iOS software team also told the WSJ that Forstall "felt the group wasn't working on enough big ideas in mobile software."In Forstall's absence, SVP Eddy Cue will take over Siri and Maps, according to the report.See the original story on CNN content partner Mashable.com.&copy; 2013 MASHABLE.com.
