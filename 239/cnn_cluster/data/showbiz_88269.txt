^_^Title^_^Hollywood's a 'scared town,' says Zombie^_^Story^_^Don't bother complaining to Rob Zombie about how Hollywood's out of original ideas and keeps remaking old movies.The director of the reworked &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween 2&quot; -- whose future plans include the possibility of a new take on 1958's &quot;The Blob&quot; -- will probably agree with you.&quot;I used to be one of those people -- and still sort of am,&quot; said Zombie, the rocker/director whose &quot;Halloween 2&quot; is set to be re-released in about 1,000 theaters this weekend in honor of its namesake holiday. &quot;But, unfortunately, I don't run Hollywood, so I kind of have to look at what's there and go, 'Well, OK, this is how they want to do things and I want to make movies.'&quot;So I try to do what I tried to with 'Halloween' -- take something and as much turn it into my own thing as possible.&quot;Zombie, whose &quot;House of 1,000 Corpses&quot; and &quot;The Devil's Rejects&quot; became instant cult favorites, called Hollywood &quot;a scared town&quot; where, especially in tough economic times, studios want to put money behind what they think is a sure bet.&quot;I have lots of original ideas that maybe will get made,&quot; he said. &quot;But everyone ... even if you bring them the most obscure movie that nobody's ever heard of -- they want to remake that.&quot;As his movie, originally released in late August, re-hits screens, Zombie will be hitting the road.Perhaps still best-known as front man for the multi-platinum-selling '90s metal band White Zombie and solo efforts like 1998's &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe,&quot; Zombie kicked off his first headlining tour since 2007 on Thursday. Beginning in Phoenix, Arizona, the tour includes a blowout Halloween-night show at the Palladium in Los Angeles featuring music and characters from &quot;H2&quot;.Zombie said juggling careers in rock and film is sometimes tough, but in the end helps keep him sane.&quot;They're a great counter-balance,&quot; he said. &quot;It's both sides of my personality. I have a subdued, meticulous side that needs to obsess over work. But I have the other side where you just need to go crazy, you know?&quot;And while one might think making over-the-top horror movies would fill his &quot;crazy&quot; quotient, Zombie said that's not usually the case.&quot;It doesn't matter if you're shooting a bloody murder or some romantic scene,&quot; he said. &quot;The process by which you're getting it on film is mostly the same.&quot;The tour comes in advance of Zombie's upcoming album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe 2,&quot; which was originally set for a November 11 release but has now been pushed back to an unspecified date next year. The first single -- &quot;What?&quot; -- features Zombie's trademark heavy grooves, strong hooks and horror-show lyrics combined with distorted vocals reminiscent of '90s aggro-industrial band Ministry.But Zombie said he's hard pressed to describe the record himself.&quot;Music is the most confusing thing as to how people perceive it,&quot; he said. &quot;You play somebody something and you think, 'Oh this is my classic sound' and they go, 'Oh my God, it's so different.'&quot;And then you play something that you think is so different and they go 'Oh yeah, that's pretty much what I expected.' &quot; In addition to pondering &quot;The Blob,&quot; which remains in development, Zombie recently finished editing a director's cut of &quot;Halloween 2&quot; for DVD and has an original film, &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex,&quot; in the works with a tentative 2013 release date. The Internet Movie Database describes &quot;Rex&quot; as the story of an ex-con boxer who gets caught up in an underground fight ring.In disappointing news for hardcore fans, he said Captain Spaulding and the rest of the degenerates from &quot;House of 1,000 Corpses&quot; and &quot;Devil's Rejects&quot; are likely retired for good -- at least on his watch.&quot;I think 'House of 1,000 Corpses,' in about 10 more years, will probably be one of the movies that people want to remake,&quot; he said.Loading weather data ...
