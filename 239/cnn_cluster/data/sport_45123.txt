^_^Title^_^Thomas relief after admitting he is gay^_^Story^_^Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has spoken of his relief at finally making public the fact he is gay -- and now wants to become a role model for gay people in sport.Speaking to British news channel ITN, Thomas revealed why it has taken him so long to speak openly about his sexuality.&quot;Every gay man will tell you that 'coming out' is like a weight lifted from your shoulders and beng able to walk down the street knowing that there is nothing for me to hide has been a liberating experience, &quot; admitted Thomas -- the most capped player in Wales history with 100 appearances for his country.&quot;I knew I was gay at 18, but to come out then would have meant I would not have achieved what I did in rugby. I loved rugby so much and it was so important to me that I made the decision to keep my sexuality secret. People may disagree with that, but it was my belief and my decision.&quot;Since my announcement I have had an amazing response and have not had one negative comment or any abuse. I think it proves there is a place for gay men in every walk of life.&quot;Gay men are accepted in films, music and politics because people came out and broke the mould and stereotype in those industries.&quot;What I am trying to do is break the trend in rugby and sport in general and show any aspiring sportsman, regardless of his age, that the mould has been broken. &quot;It is not an issue if a straight man plays rugby -- and I hope my decision will ensure it is not an issue if a gay man plays rugby.&quot;Loading weather data ...
