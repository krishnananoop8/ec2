^_^Title^_^'Avatar' unstoppable at box office^_^Story^_^(Entertainment Weekly) -- Nothing can stop the reign of &quot;Avatar.&quot; A scant 16-percent drop in its sixth weekend of release has helped James Cameron's sci-fi spectacle become the second highest-grossing movie of all time. In contrast, the new releases failed to make a significant mark, with the apocalyptic film Legion performing strongest with an estimated $18.2 million and a second-place showing. Avatar earned an additional $36 million this weekend, climbing to $552.8 million domestically and surpassing &quot;The Dark Knight's&quot; $533.3 million domestic haul. If it continues to drop in the 20-percent range as it has the last few weekends this time it only fell 16 percent it's on track to is top Titanic's $600.8 million by mid-February. Worldwide, Avatar is also the second-highest grossing movie of all time at $1.8 billion, trailing &quot;Titanic&quot; by less than $7 million. In contrast, none of the new releases is likely to have much of an afterlife. &quot;Legion&quot; may have bowed in second place, but it earned a dismal C- from exit pollster Cinemascore, meaning there is unlikely to be much positive word-of-mouth for this movie. Twentieth Century Fox's &quot;The Tooth Fairy,&quot; scored better with audiences (it's Cinemascore is an A-) but with a $14.5 million gross and a fourth place debut that portends an inauspicious future for this family-friendly comedy starring Dwayne Johnson. And then there is &quot;Extraordinary Measures.&quot; This debut film from nascent studio CBS Film didn't connect with audiences. Earning only $7 million for a three-day frame, the Harrison Ford/Brendan Fraser medical weepie landed in seventh place and will likely be out of the top 10 by next weekend when the Disney comedy &quot;When in Rome&quot; opens opposite Mel Gibson's R-rated revenge drama &quot;Edge of Darkness.&quot; For second week holdovers, &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; both performed strongly. &quot;Eli&quot; dropped 48 percent to land in third place with $17 million. It's total cume stands at $62 million. &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; also dropped 48 percent, bringing its total gross to $32 million. The rest of the top ten included &quot;Sherlock Holmes,&quot; grossing an additional $7.1 million for a sixth slot, and &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot; earning $6.5 million for eighth place. &quot;It's Complicated&quot; and &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot; rounded out the top ten with $6.2 and $4.7 million, respectively.
