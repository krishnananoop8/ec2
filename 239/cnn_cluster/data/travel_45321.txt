^_^Title^_^Landing gear part fell from cargo plane over Seattle ^_^Story^_^A landing gear part that fell from the sky into a suburban Seattle neighborhood came from a ABX Air jet, the cargo airline formerly known as Airborne Express, the company said on Monday.The part, about the size of a refrigerator door panel, narrowly missed a parked car in Friday's incident. No one on the ground was hurt and the plane landed safely.ABX Air spokesman Paul Cunningham confirmed reports that the object was a landing gear panel from one of its Boeing 767s, which was arriving in Seattle from Cincinnati.The plane was manufactured in 1985, records showed."We are very concerned about this sort of thing," Cunningham told CNN. "We have programs and procedures that we use to try and ensure the safety and reliability of our operations. This is quite an unusual thing."The Federal Aviation Administration, which declined to identify the owner of the plane, recovered the part, Cunningham and witnesses said.The FAA said it was investigating and Cunningham said ABX was cooperating."We have no information yet to determine what the causes were related to this. It could have been any number of things," he said.Resident Leah Dermody told CNN affiliate that neighbors claimed to have heard a plane pass very low over the Seattle-area neighborhood just before the part fell.Mike M.
