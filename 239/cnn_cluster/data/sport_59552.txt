I heard Bode was leading and Weibrecht was in third and those guys don't slow down -- they go hard,&quot; he told reporters.&quot;I prepared well. I'm in top form and am just enjoying it.&quot;Miller, who won a bronze in the downhill, now has four Olympic medals but will hope for that elusive first gold in Sunday's super-combined.The race was marred by an accident to Swedish veteran Patrik Jaerbyn, who was airlifted by helicopter off the mountain after a nasty crash.The oldest competitor in the event at nearly 41 years of age, Jaerbyn finished third in a World Cup super-G at Val Gardena last December, but was off the pace when he clipped a gate and took a crashing fall.
