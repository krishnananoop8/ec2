But amid the gossip and allegations, the 41-year-old has defended his decision.He told CNN: &quot;I enjoy it. I feel I have the right to do what I enjoy. Whether I put in dispute my reputation...I just feel good about my decision and I have so much support from people.&quot;&quot;I certainly want to make it a successful return,&quot; he continued. &quot;I'm only happy if I'm back on the winning road with the team. This is what I'm working for, this is the joy of the passion for Formula 1.&quot;His decision has been supported by some of the biggest names in F1.Finnish F1 driver for Team Lotus Heikki Kovalainen told CNN the criticisms towards Schumacher were unfair.&quot;People had high expectations, people expected him to win. But (Mercedes) didn't have a car to win and second of all, things have changed since he left Formula 1.&quot;Fellow F1 champion Alain Prost said no-one should judge or criticize a driver of his caliber, saying, &quot;For me, it is difficult, almost impossible to go back to the title after three years...But if there's one driver who'd be able to do it, I think it's Michael.&quot;Team principal and co-owner of Mercedes, Ross Brawn, admits the team has had a disappointing year and credits some of that to Schumacher.&quot;It's been disappointing, in overall performance, we haven't had the car, Michael's taken a little time to get up to the performance he'll be able to deliver. I've seen patches of that performance...the last few races of the season was the Michael Schumacher I expected to see.But on a more positive note, Brawn added: &quot;Now it's all coming together and I think next year we're going to have a really exciting time.&quot;Schumacher admits it's been a sluggish return to the track, but remains positive, saying: &quot;It's certainly not as successful as I thought initially and many other people have thought.&quot;&quot;But then having such a strong group and team behind, Mercedes pushing it so hard, I have no doubt about success in the future.&quot;Loading weather data ...
