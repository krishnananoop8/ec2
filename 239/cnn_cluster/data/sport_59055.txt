The France Galop stewards will be studying the file within the next fortnight before deciding what action will be taken in accordance with the Rules of Racing," it concluded.The 41-year-old Dettori is one of the most recognizable figures in flat racing, winning the champion jockey's title three times in England.He is most famous for going through the card at Ascot in a meeting in 1996 with seven straight winners.His lawyer has said that the substance involved, which has not been disclosed, was not performance enhancing.Dettori could escape without further punishment or face a maximum six-month worldwide ban from racing.Last month, Dettori's 18-year association with the Godolphin stable came to an end and he planned to ride next year as an unattached jockey.He had four rides at the meeting on September 16, two for Dubai-owned Godolphin, without securing a winner.Loading weather data ...
