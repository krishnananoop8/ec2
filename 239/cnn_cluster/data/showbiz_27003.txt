^_^Title^_^Female writer says Letterman show had 'hostile work environment'^_^Story^_^Watch as a former writer for David Letterman joins Joy Behar in a prime time exclusive and describes the &quot;sexually charged atmosphere&quot; on the set of the show. &quot;Joy Behar,&quot; tonight, 9 ET on HLN.  The persistent sexual politics behind the scenes at late-night talk shows is far from a joke, believes former &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; writer Nell Scovell.Scovell was the second female writer ever hired for &quot;Late Night&quot; when she got the job in 1990, two years after she'd applied.  In 27 years, &quot;Late Night&quot; and its current iteration, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; have hired only seven women, Scovell said said in a tell-all essay on VanityFair.com. She was unavailable for comment. The talk show was a dream job for the writer, who had penned an episode for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; by the time Letterman called. But when she walked through the doors of 30 Rockefeller Center, she realized working at &quot;Late Night&quot; wasn't the career move she'd hoped for, she wrote.Scovell said she was well aware that Letterman and other &quot;high-level male employees&quot; were rumored to have sexual relationships with female staff members, whom she believed benefited professionally from their office affairs. Needless to say, the work environment was rife with tension.&quot;Did these female staffers have access to information and wield power disproportionate to their job titles? Yes,&quot; Scovell wrote. &quot;Did that create a hostile work environment? Yes. Did that make me feel demeaned? Completely. Did I say anything at the time? Sadly, no.&quot; Although Letterman never made a pass at her, Scovell said that the host did show enough &quot;extra attention&quot; that it was noticed by another writer.After a few months, she'd &quot;seen enough to know that I was not going to thrive professionally in that workplace ... although there were various reasons for that, sexual politics did play a major part.&quot;CBS did not have a comment as of Wednesday. But Scovell believes the issue of female employees on late-night talk shows extends past the boudoir and straight into the writers' rooms, which in her view are simply wittier cousins of other high-paying positions facing gender inequality.&quot;I don't want compensation ... I don't want revenge,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I just want Dave to hire some qualified female writers and then treat them with respect. And that goes for Jay and Conan, too.&quot;There are no women writing for the Letterman, Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien shows, Scovell said, and it's not because there aren't any who are interested in applying.&quot;[Women] certainly don't [apply] in the same numbers as men. But that's partly because the shows often rely on current (white male) writers to recommend their funny (white male) writers,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I'm also aware of several worthy females who have submitted material and never heard back.&quot;She wonders if women aren't on the staffs because male writers believe they would throw off the workroom dynamic.&quot;[Men] want to be able to scarf an entire bag of potato chips while cracking fat jokes and making lewd comments without fear of feminine disapproval,&quot; she said. &quot;But [women writers] are co-workers, not wives. Crack a decent fart joke and, as professionals, [women] will laugh.&quot;Scovell said she isn't calling for the talk shows to relax their standards, but rather &quot;give feedback and encouragement&quot; to submissions and &quot;post submission-packet requirements on Web site[s] so everyone has equal access.&quot;She admits it won't happen overnight, but Scovell still holds on to her dream. &quot;One day,&quot; Scovell said, &quot;a late-night writer's room will be filled with poop jokes and fart jokes ... and everyone will laugh, including men and women of all creeds and colors.&quot;Loading weather data ...
