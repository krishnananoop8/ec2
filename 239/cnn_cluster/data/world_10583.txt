Mrs. Middleton's hat was by Berkshire-based Jane Corbett.Gallery: What the royal wedding guests woreThe Duchess of Cornwall stayed loyal to designer Anna Valentine -- the woman who designed her wedding outfits and is credited with revamping her image. She wore a champagne silk dress and a duck-egg blue and champagne coat with hand-embroidered detailing, teamed with a hat by her favorite milliner, Philip Treacy, and shoes by Jimmy Choo.Queen of fashion Victoria Beckham made an elegant arrival dressed in one of her own autumn/winter creations, specially altered to take account of her baby bump.
