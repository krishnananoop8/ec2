^_^Title^_^Apple triggers 'religious' reaction in fans' brains, report says^_^Story^_^Next time Grandma asks why you're going to the mall on Sunday morning instead of church, tell her you're going to Apple Chapel.For Apple fans, the brand triggers a reaction in the brain that's not unlike that of religious devotees, according to a BBC documentary series that cites neurological research.The neuroscientists ran a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test on an Apple fanatic and discovered that images of the technology company's gadgets lit up the same parts of the brain as images of a deity do for religious people, the report says.The first episode of the documentary shows Apple employees &quot;whipped up into some sort of crazy, evangelical frenzy&quot; at the recent opening of an Apple store in London.Observers and Apple critics have long accused fans of the tech company of taking their infatuation to an extreme. People have gone to great lengths to prove their love of Apple with tattoos, bumper stickers and home shrines to outmoded Mac computers. Apple's cult-like following was highlighted in a 2009 documentary called &quot;Macheads.&quot;A blog, aptly titled Cult of Mac, wrote on Thursday about Oakland, California, resident Gary Allen's cross-country pilgrimage to Apple's first store in Virginia to celebrate the retail chain's 10th anniversary this week.In speeches, Pope Benedict XVI has said technology consumption poses a threat to religion and the Roman Catholic church. The holy leader told a Palm Sunday crowd last month that technology cannot replace God.However, apparently it may inspire god-like devotion.Loading weather data ...
