^_^Title^_^California police arrest suspect in nursing student's slaying^_^Story^_^Police in California arrested Wednesday a woman they said is suspected of killing a nursing student who was last seen in a hospital parking garage more than three months ago.Giselle Esteban, 27, was arrested in Union City, California, Wednesday, Lt. Roger Keener of the Hayward Police Department told reporters.Evidence -- including blood stains, security camera footage, cell phone records and DNA found on a shoe -- led to Esteban's arrest &quot;for the murder of Michelle Le,&quot; Keener said. Esteban was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon and was listed as an inmate in an Alameda County jail without bail.Le, a 26-year-old nursing student, disappeared on May 27 after telling classmates at a hospital in Hawyard, California, that she was going to get something from her car, Keener said. She never returned and the abandoned vehicle was later found about a half-mile away.Investigators searched Esteban's house shortly after Le disappeared. As part of that search, Keener said, they found Le's DNA on one of Esteban's shoes.Police have classified the case as a homicide, but her family has held out hope for her safe return, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Le's family has offered a $100,000 reward for her return or for information on her whereabouts.&quot;At this point she is still missing and we will fight to bring her home every day until we have her with our family again,&quot; cousin Krystine Dinh told reporters after police announced Esteban's arrest Wednesday.Le's 23-year-old brother, Michael, told reporters that Thursday will be his birthday -- a day his sister would always call him.&quot;I just want to hear her voice so badly, and the only thing I'm going to be wishing for is for her to come back home,&quot; he said.Keener pledged that police would continue their search.&quot;We will not consider this investigation to be complete until Michelle is found,&quot; he said.Loading weather data ...
