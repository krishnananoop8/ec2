^_^Title^_^Superb Nadal powers into quarterfinals^_^Story^_^Rafael Nadal remains on course for a remarkable sixth successive Monte Carlo Masters triumph after defeating Michael Berrer in straight sets to reach the last eight on Thursday.Nadal beat Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker 6-1 6-0 on Wednesday -- and the five-time champion dished out another clay-court masterclass to sweep past German Berrer by the same scoreline.Berrer was no match for the second-seeded Spaniard, who made just eight unforced errors on his way to a 29th successive victory in the principality.&quot;I played better than yesterday because I played higher, I played close to the lines, and my feeling is I had more control on the ball,&quot; Nadal told the official ATP Web site. Nadal will now face compatriot and ninth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero, who saw off fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 7-5.That pair were joined in the quarterfinals by three other Spaniards, with Albert Montanes producing the shock of the day by dumping out fourth seed Marin Cilic 6-4 6-4.There were also wins for 11th seed David Ferrer, who saw off eighth seed Ivan Ljubicic -- the winner at Indian Wells last month -- 6-0 7-6 and sixth seed Fernando Verdasco, who recovered from the loss of the opening set to defeat 10th seed Tomas Berdych 5-7 6-3 6-2.
