Security Council on Thursday condemned Syria's shelling of a border town in Turkey and appealed for restraint from both countries."The members of the Security Council underscored that this incident highlighted the grave impact the crisis in Syria has on the security of its neighbors and on regional peace and security," said Gert Rosenthal, ambassador from Guatemala, speaking in his role as council president.The shelling of the Turkish town of Akcakale resulted in the deaths of five civilians -- all of them women and children -- and a number of injuries, Rosenthal said."The members of the council demanded that such violations of international law stop immediately and are not repeated," he continued, calling for Syria to respect Turkey's sovereignty and territorial integrity.The announcement at the world body in New York came as Turkey, retaliating for Wednesday's incident, shelled a Syrian military position for a second consecutive day and authorized its military forces to venture beyond its borders.Meanwhile, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations urged Turkey to exercise restraint. Syria "is not seeking any escalation with any of its neighbors, including Turkey," Bashar Ja'afari told reporters after expressing his government's "deepest condolences" over the shelling.But Ja'afari also called on Turkey to stop armed insurgents from crossing its border with Syria and to prevent media coverage of opposition groups operating from its territory."Syria bases its behavior with neighboring countries to the rules of good neighborliness and respect for national sovereignties of states, and it invites, in return, those states to respect the national sovereignty of Syria, and to cooperate in border control and prevention of the infiltration of insurgents and terrorists, according to what Syria has always done," Ja'afari said in a letter given to U.N. officials.Also Thursday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that authorities had "foiled an infiltration attempt from Turkish Territories into Kherbet al-Jouz town in Idlib province and killed several of them, including gunmen from non-Syrian nationalities.
