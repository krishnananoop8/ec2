^_^Title^_^What's in an Appalachian Trail hiker's backpack?^_^Story^_^Section-hikers carry with them virtually everything they'll need for days or even weeks. Backpacks are designed to transfer much of the weight to the wearer's hips. Here's what I carried on a recent four-day hike through part of New York. Many of the items are in sacks to keep the pack organized. The total weight of the backpack above and everything in it, excluding water, is 25 pounds.

They can get by without a tent by staying in shelters and can resupply as needed in towns along the route. Here's what &quot;Margolo&quot; is carrying on her hike from Georgia to Maine.
