I'm feeling very confident with my serve, hopefully for the rest of the season. Today I did lose serve for the first time this week, but finals are tough to play."I played perhaps my worst tennis of the week at the start of the match, I came out very nervous, but I fought back. Later on I started feeling very confident and in control all the time."I will try to keep on winning; I'm looking forward to my next event. It's a big challenge for me this season to try and move closer to the number one position."Williams eyes Azarenka finalDel Potro, who is currently ranked seventh in the world, is the second Argentine to win in Rotterdam after Guillermo Vilas, who triumphed in 1982 and finished runner-up the following year.Benneteau had hoped to become the fifth Frenchman to win the title after recording a shock victory over Roger Federer in the semifinal.But the 31-year-old, who has lost all eight ATP title finals, was unable to break his duck on this occasion."I can only congratulate Juan Martin," he told reporters."I did my best, but he was just too good for me today.
