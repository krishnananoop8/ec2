^_^Title^_^Christina Hendricks: Curvy, confident, gorgeous ^_^Story^_^(Health.com) -- Wearing a body-hugging dress and heels to our interview at an Irish pub in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles, Christina Hendricks is seriously channeling Joan Holloway, the take-no-prisoners office manager she plays on &quot;Mad Men.&quot; But as soon as she sits down and starts talking, the 35-year-old Tennessee-born actress transforms into the kind of fun-loving girlfriend you always have a ball with. Over a late-afternoon cup of chili, Christina -- who recently wed actor Geoffrey Arend -- talks about making workouts fun and the importance of keeping a &quot;no regrets&quot; attitude.Q: You've lived all over the country -- Tennessee, Idaho, Virginia, Georgia, New York. Which of these places sticks with you most today?A: Idaho. I really do love being outdoors -- I mean, you'd never think it in my high heels and pencil skirt! [Laughs.] But I really do miss the smell of hay and farms, and I like milking a cow. I'm quite good at it!Q: Really? What's your strategy?A: There's a trick! If you lean your head against the udder, it produces more milk, 'cause [your head] is like a calf. [Laughs.]Q: Joan on &quot;Mad Men&quot; is sexy and tough. Are you like that in real life?A: When I first started to play her, I would think, &quot;Oh my God, I would never want to hang out with this person. She would crush me like a bug!&quot; And then, I started to love her. I think Joan and I have a &quot;no excuses&quot; kind of mentality -- I'm going to stand by my decisions, no regrets, no apologies. But she is far more confident than I am. She's far more confident than most women are in the world! [Laughs.]Health.com: Joan Holloway Barbie loses curvesQ: Many women have said they consider your body one they admire or want the most. What do you think of all that body love?A: Really? They don't say Jessica Alba? 'Cause that's what I say! [Laughs.] It's such a compliment, because of all those times I had agents who were like, &quot;You have to lose some weight,&quot; and all of a sudden, people are celebrating it. It's like: &quot;Oh, thank you! Thank you for letting me be me.&quot;Q: When I Googled your name, the third most popular search that came up was &quot;Christina Hendricks's cup size.&quot; How does it feel to know that people are actually discussing that?A: It's weird, but it doesn't surprise me. I made the grave mistake after one awards show of reading comments online about what I wore, and I was like, [gasps] &quot;Oh my God, people are so mean!&quot; I still remember all those negative comments, despite all the wonderful positivity.

Do you have it?A: I guess my mom raised me right. She was very celebratory of her body. I never heard her once say, &quot;I feel fat.&quot; Back when I was modeling, the first time I went to Italy I was having cappuccinos every day, and I gained 15 pounds. And I felt gorgeous! I would take my clothes off in front of the mirror and be like, &quot;Oh, I look like a woman.&quot; And I felt beautiful, and I never tried to lose it, 'cause I loved it. [Laughs.]Q: You gained it from living a good life.A: It's like Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution -- real, good foods. It's OK if I have avocado and olive oil and all these delicious things, you know? I don't feel guilty about that.Q: Is there any healthy rule you believe in breaking?A: I break every healthy rule! [Laughs.]Q: Says the girl sitting in an Irish pub at 4 p.m. ...A: With a glass of Pinot Grigio. I was a dancer until I was 19. I never had to worry about working out or what I ate. So I've really had to train myself to get down to the gym. But what surprised me was that my husband said [the other day], &quot;I'm going down to work out,&quot; and I was like, &quot;Oh, I wish I was going.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Ooh! I can't believe I just said that!&quot; I'd had a busy week working 16-hour days, and I didn't get to work out, and I missed it. My friends will read this and be like, &quot;No you didn't.&quot; [Laughs.] But it's true!Health.com: Best and worst celebrity health habitsQ: Do you have any health regrets?A: My parents didn't exercise, so it was not something I saw was good for you or fun. I wish I had grown up knowing to do that. And my mother -- she'll admit it -- hated vegetables, so when we had them, they were always canned or cooked within an inch of their lives.Q: So what's your gym routine?A: I get kind of bored on the treadmill, but I do it. And I do a little bit of weight training. I'm really into the BOSU ball. You have to balance on it, and I do weights and squats on it. I'm pretty good at it, I feel sort of like a Karate Kid.Health.com: Get the body you crave with celeb-inspired workoutsQ: Any tricks for making workouts fun?A: I read magazines, and I'll try [the exercises].

I could sit down with a bag of chips and French onion dip and go to town! That would be on my last-supper list. But I discovered that dry French onion soup mix in nonfat yogurt tastes just as good. It really does!Q: Any other healthy snacking secrets?A: My husband and I started doing a Soup of the Week. We just make a big pot once a week that's healthy and in the fridge, so if we feel snacky, there's something really delicious in there. I've got lentil in the fridge right now.Q: What is your favorite relaxation ritual?A: I knit. I find that very soothing. I actually learned from Laurie Metcalf, you know that actress? She's very crafty.Q: Your skin looks so healthy. What's your secret?A: I moisturize all the time. I really like 3LAB and Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate. Also, I'll be cooking and so dry from washing my hands, I'll just take olive oil and be like, &quot;Ahh!&quot; [gestures bathing her arms and face in olive oil]. On &quot;Mad Men,&quot; we use so much powder -- it was such a matte look in the '60s. And no one wore lip gloss either. Sometimes, they'll powder your lips -- whoo! It's brutal.
