Although we do not yet know the source of infection, at this time there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission," said the WHO's Michael O'Leary."We know at this point that, in the human cases we know, the disease is very serious and a large percentage of cases have died -- or a substantial percentage have died and others are critically ill."Some of the confirmed cases had contact with animals or with environments in which animals were located. The virus has been found in a pigeon in a market in Shanghai. These events gave possibility of animal-to-human transmission, for which investigations continue."Authorities kill 20,000 birds as toll risesMeanwhile, Chinese officials say they have started work on a vaccine for the H7N9 virus.However, it may take up to eight months before the vaccine can be brought to market due to complications in the development and manufacturing process, said Liang Wannian, director of the H7N9 influenza prevention and control office under the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), according to Xinhua.Liang said the decision to put the vaccine into production will depend on whether the virus can mutate to become human-to-human transmissible."We are taking a series of measures to prevent and control infections. Infection monitoring efforts are under way in over 500 hospitals and 400 labs nationwide. We have confidence in keeping the disease under control," he said.Ke Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.
