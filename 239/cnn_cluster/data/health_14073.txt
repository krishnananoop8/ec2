^_^Title^_^H1N1 virus attacks deep into the lungs^_^Story^_^New York In the rare cases when the H1N1 virus kills, scientists have found, it penetrates deep into the lungs, creating widespread damage -- a pattern similar to what killed millions during previous flu pandemics in 1918 and 1957. The New York Office of Chief Medical Examiner examined medical records, autopsy reports and microscopic slides of 34 people with H1N1 who died between May 15 and July 9, 2009, during the early days of the pandemic.The report found that among those deaths, inflammation and damage in the lungs extended all the way to the alveoli, tiny sacs at the farthest end of the lungs' airways. &quot;Generally, flu stays in the upper airways,&quot; said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. &quot;What this shows is clearly this virus has capability of infecting and causing inflammation and destruction of cells from the trachea, all the way down into smaller cells of the lungs.&quot;The cells of the lung get directly attacked by the virus,&quot; said Fauci.The damage appears in computerized scans as opaque patches that normally  would not appear in the lungs, and which obstruct lung function.

We are keeping an eye on obesity as a risk factor for H1N1 death.&quot; Track the H1N1 virus in your stateThe study gives interesting insight into the mechanism behind H1N1 deaths, but will not change the current response to the virus, said Fauci.Loading weather data ...
