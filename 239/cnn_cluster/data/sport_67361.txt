Alpine skiingMiller had earlier won gold in the combined, silver in the super-G and bronze in the downhill to add to his two second-place finishes from 2002, making him the most-decorated American skier.He was seeking to become the first skier to win medals in each of the five alpine events, and the first to claim four podiums at the same Olympics.But in difficult conditions after heavy snow, the 32-year-old was one of 48 of the 102 starters who failed to complete the first run after missing an early gate.Compatriot Ted Ligety, the combined champion in Turin four years ago, had earlier gone off the course and Austria's world champion Manfred Pranger also missed out.&quot;It's unfortunate to make a mistake so early in the course before you really have a rhythm for it. But that's the way slalom goes,&quot; Miller said in a team statement. &quot;When you take risks in slalom, you don't only take risks on the bottom half. You take it from the very first gate. And if you don't, you can give away a tenth of a second on the first two gates.&quot;But overall this Olympics was amazing how many things went my way. I really couldn't be much happier. To have three medals, and the two medals I didn't get I skied hard.&quot; Italy's Giuliano Razzoli followed up his leading time from the first run by winning gold from Croatia's Ivica Kostelic, clocking a total of one minute 39.32 seconds.Kostelic, the older brother of women's skiing great Janica Kostelic, won his second silver of the Games in 1:39.48, with Sweden's Andre Myhrer edging out defending champion Benjamin Raich of Austria for the bronze.Austria won all three medals in the event four years ago, but fell flat this time with Marcel Hirscher fifth and 2006 silver medallist Reinfried Herbst back in 10th.Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong was second from last on his Olympic debut.The &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; clocked 2:22.60 to be ahead of only Albania's Erjon Tola (2:43.88).BobsleighHolcomb followed up his world title last year, the United States' first in 50 years, by claiming the Americans' first gold in the four-man bobsleigh since 1948.He and his crew of Justin Olsen, Steve Mesler and Curtis Tomasevicz clocked a combined four-heat time of 3:24.46 to head off Andre Lange's Germany team (3:24.84 ), with Canada's Lyndon Rush narrowly edged into bronze (3:24.85).
