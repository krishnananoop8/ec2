In the London 2012 Olympic Games the sailing events are divided into ten classes -- six for men and four for women.This summer's Games will be the first Olympics at which sailing has no "open class" -- where men and women can compete against each other. Things will change again for the Rio Games, where the mixed class -- in which men and women compete in the same team -- is making a comeback in form of the new "mixed two person multihull" event.Keeping scoreThere are two disciplines -- match racing (one against one), fleet racing (mass start) -- featured in the London 2012 Olympics. Only one out of ten events, the Women's Elliott 6m class, is using the match racing format.In match racing teams compete against each other in a series of round robin matches, with the top teams progressing to the final knockout stages.Fleet racing is slightly more complicated. Each event has a series of races and points are awarded in each race: the first boat scores one point, second scores two points and so on.After ten races (15 races in the Skiff event) each boat is allowed to discard its worst score and the ten boats with the lowest accumulated scores qualify for the medal race. In the final race, points are doubled and added to the opening series' scores to decide the top ten positions. The athlete or crew with the lowest number of points is the winner.The 2012 favoritesThis summer 380 sailors (237 men and 143 women) from 63 countries will compete in the Olympic sailing events. The home nation currently tops the overall Olympic medal tally. Team GB is expected to win medals in more or less every event but with great teams and individuals sailors from Australia, the U.S., France and Brazil the elusive gold medals could be anyone's for the taking.British Ben Ainslie captures fourth successive Olympic gold medal -- becoming the greatest Olympic sailor ever One of the fiercest rivalries this summer is between British sailor Paul Goodison and Australian Tom Slingsby in the men's Laser event. Goodison won gold in the Beijing 2008 Olympics beating Slingsby who was the favorite at the time. Since then Slingsby has come back with a vengeance and has beaten Goodison at all major events, and the pair who used to be good friends are no longer on speaking terms.Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen are the favorites in the men's two person 49er class. They are the world number ones, the reigning world champions and currently unbeaten at the London 2012 sailing venue.Another likely golden Aussie crew consists of Malcolm Page and Mathew Belcher who are competing in the men's 470 event.Since the 2008 Olympics they have won the world title every year.Loading weather data ...
