^_^Title^_^iTunes11 finally available for download^_^Story^_^At long last, iTunes 11 is finally available for download.Apple was originally supposed to release iTunes 11 -- a total revamp of the longstanding music and apps manager -- in October. The launch was then delayed because of "engineering difficulties."Reports surfaced earlier this week that Apple would release iTunes 11 within its promised November timeframe.SEE ALSO: iTunes 11: What's NewSince its debut in 2001, iTunes has morphed from a standard music player into something larger and more complex. It's no longer just a music player -- it's also an App store, a music and movies store and a way to manage iPod, iPhone and iPad devices.In other words, iTunes has become a bloated, slow, unwieldy mess.Whether or not iTunes 11 can solve all these problems is unclear. We'll report back later with a full hands-on review.In the meantime, Mac users can grab the update from Software Update and on Windows by having iTunes "Check for Updates."The software is also available for download directly from Apple -- though the download links may take a few minutes to propagate.Do you still use iTunes?
