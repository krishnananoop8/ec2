^_^Title^_^The legacy of 'Tron'^_^Story^_^It was 1981, and Cindy Morgan was filming what she was told would be a half-live-action, half-cartoon for Walt Disney Pictures on a completely black movie set.The director, Steve Lisberger, came up to her and told her that she was going to be flying a &quot;solar sailer&quot; ship, and at another point, she would cross a bridge -- two things that she didn't see in front of her.&quot;I asked him, 'What the hell is going on?' and he showed me these great Syd Mead graphics,&quot; Morgan said.Mead, an industrial designer, was in charge of special effects for the movie, called &quot;Tron.&quot; It would be the first time that an entire world was created with computer animation.Twenty-eight years later, the movie, which cost a reported $17 million to make, has spawned a sequel, &quot;Tron: Legacy,&quot; with a much larger budget.What is it about this movie -- considered a box office flop at the time (it made $33 million, according to boxofficemojo.com) -- that made fans at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con go wild to get a surprise look at &quot;Legacy&quot; test footage?Interest has certainly remained high through the years. &quot;Wherever I would go in the world, no matter what language they spoke, the word 'Tron' would come up,&quot; said Bruce Boxleitner, who played the character of Tron and returns in the sequel.&quot;The computer culture was just starting up when we did 'Tron.' There was no internet,&quot; said Jeff Bridges, star of both films. &quot;I think [the fans are] guys who were raised on video games, and have a fondness for it.&quot;You could certainly say that iReporter David Fike has a fondness for the &quot;Tron&quot; video game. &quot;Anytime I went anywhere with a 'Tron' arcade game, I was begging my parents for quarters,&quot; he said. Decades later, Fike owns an arcade console of his own, purchased at an auction. &quot;It had been in a Wal-Mart for most of its life and had some nicks and scratches,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm trying to restore the cabinet and get it as close as I can to making it look somewhat new.&quot;And, of course, the movie has a special place in his heart. &quot;This was the first movie inside of a video game, so something sparked the imagination and fascinated me. It's probably still my favorite movie of all time despite how badly people reflect on it now,&quot; he said.Fike theorizes that, &quot;It was so different, and so ahead of its time that people just didn't get it.&quot;Most people even somewhat familiar with the original movie remember the suits worn by characters inside the computer.&quot;The costumes were unbearable, there was no eating lunch in those things,&quot; Morgan said.Even so, the original movie's suits are a favorite among fans, no more so than iReporter Jay Maynard, who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; and &quot;Tosh.0&quot; as &quot;Tron Guy.&quot; &quot;What got me interested at the time the original came out was that I had just begun working as a mainframe systems programmer,&quot; Maynard said. &quot;I had always been interested in computers. This was the first time anyone tried showing what went on inside a computer.&quot;Maynard isn't alone in being inspired by the movie in that way. At conventions, Morgan said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of &quot;Tron.&quot;Fellow iReporter Joe Machos, a data processor at an insurance company at the time (not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie), saw the movie on opening day, July 9, 1982. &quot;I left that theater, as one might say, rapt,&quot; he said. &quot;It had taken me to another place.&quot;He noted how, with its use of terms like RAM, &quot;rezzing,&quot; and &quot;end of line,&quot; it was far ahead of its time. &quot;It accurately predicted a future. We now have this thing called cyberspace. When you say that now, it resonates with people.&quot;Machos also is a hard-core fan of all things Disney. During a trip to Disney's Tomorrowland, he left a comment with a woman who worked there asking, &quot;Where's 'Tron?'&quot;According to Machos, she asked him, &quot;Wasn't that a box office failure?&quot; Machos then pointed to an image from &quot;Fantasia&quot; -- which didn't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying, &quot;That was, too.&quot;iReport: A chat with the cast of &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;With the imminent release of the sequel, fans have been clamoring for a Blu-ray version of the original, which is quite difficult to find on DVD (Netflix's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on &quot;moratorium&quot;).According to Disney, earlier DVD releases are simply out of circulation and a Blu-ray version that Lisberger is personally overseeing will be available early next year.&quot;What I think Disney is doing is smart,&quot; said Machos, who thinks it's a good idea to re-establish &quot;Tron&quot; for a new generation. He plans to be at the first midnight screening in costume.iReport: Jeff Bridges' &quot;zen thing&quot; in &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;Aside from the technological, early cyberpunk aspects of &quot;Tron&quot; and other themes (Morgan sees a spiritual component to it; both films have something of a religious subtext), another explanation for its long-standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before.&quot;The recognizers, those giant staple looking things, I thought those were crazy cool,&quot; said iReporter Steve Hungsberg. &quot;I saw the new movie being promoted at Comic-Con and I bought one of each of the recognizer toys there. I also got one for my son. The recognizer was by far the coolest.&quot;Fike hopes that &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; will continue that tradition. &quot;I hope the disc battles are as epic as everyone that's already seen it is saying.&quot;Just before catching a sneak preview of the movie, Maynard said, &quot;Everything that I've seen about the new film has impressed me immensely.&quot;No matter the reason, there's just something about &quot;Tron.&quot;As Morgan put it, &quot;Technology was no longer something dull and dry, technology became magical. That's the secret of 'Tron.'&quot; Loading weather data ...
