^_^Title^_^Formula One 2012: Red Bull^_^Story^_^If the last two years are anything to go by, 2012 will once again see every other team and driver in Formula One desperately trying to keep pace with Red Bull.The Austrian-owned marque have clinched back-to-back drivers' and constructors' titles, and in German superstar Sebastian Vettel they boast the sport's youngest double world champion.Alongside Vettel will be experienced Australian driver Mark Webber, in addition to the genius of technical chief Adrian Newey -- the brains behind the all-conquering RB7 car.Out of 19 grands prix last season, Red Bull started 18 on pole and took the checkered flag in 12.After finishing 153 points ahead of second-placed McLaren in the constructors' standings, it is clear the 11 other teams have a huge gap to bridge if 2012 is going to be any different -- despite both Vettel and Webber claiming that this year the title race will be a lot closer.Sebastian VettelThe former Toro Rosso driver enters his fourth season with Red Bull seeking to become only the eighth driver to win three world championships. Only Michael Schumacher and 1950s legend Juan Manuel Fangio have won three in a row.Vettel secured his first title after a nailbiting five-driver shootout at the final grand prix of 2010, but his triumph last year was far more comprehensive.He was a huge 122 points ahead of McLaren's second-placed Jenson Button in last year's drivers' standings after claiming 11 grands prix victories.The 24-year-old has already racked up 22 race wins in his career, all but one of which have come in the last three seasons.Mark WebberThe 35-year-old spent last season in Vettel's shadow, having to wait until the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix for his first and only win of the year.Webber did qualify fastest on three occasions, but that figure compares poorly to Vettel's imperious record of 15 pole positions.The former Williams driver signed a contract extension with Red Bull in August 2011, but the deal expires at the end of the forthcoming season.Closing the 134-point gap which existed between him and Vettel in 2011 would help Webber earn a new contract with the Britain-based team.ResultsAustralia: Vettel 2nd, Webber 4thMalaysia: Webber 4th, Vettel 11thChina: Webber 4th, Vettel 5thBahrain: Vettel 1st, Webber 4thSpain: Vettel 6th, Webber 11thMonaco: Webber 1st, Vettel 4thCanada: Vettel 4th, Webber 7thEurope: Webber 4th, Vettel DNFBritain: Webber 1st, Vettel 3rdGermany: Vettel 5th, Webber 8thHungary: Vettel 4th, Webber 8thBelgium: Vettel 2nd, Webber 6thItaly: Vettel 5th, Webber 20thSingapore: Vettel 1st, Webber 11thJapan: Vettel 1st, Webber 9thKorea: Vettel 1st, Webber 2ndIndia: Vettel 1st, Webber 3rdAbu Dhabi: Vettel 3rd, Webber DNFBrazil: Webber 4th, Vettel 6thLoading weather data ...
