"It's been a different one, hasn't it?""I wouldn't say it was crazy out there. The word I would use is 'enthusiastic'," said McIlroy. "It's good to see so many people out there. So many people that follow golf and want to watch us play. I hope that continues."Many observers see China as the next market for golf to conquer, with an expanding, aspirational middle class taking up the game in significant numbers.McIlroy came to Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million people, straight after finishing second at the European Tour's $7 million BMW Masters in Shanghai, a tournament he won last year.Woods, who has won 14 major titles to his rival's two, traveled to China after finishing tied for fourth at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia on Sunday.Loading weather data ...
