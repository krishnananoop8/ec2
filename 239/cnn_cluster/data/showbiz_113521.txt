^_^Title^_^'Up in the Air' leads Golden Globe nominations^_^Story^_^Despite an industry dominated by young Hollywood, older actresses ruled the Golden Globe nominations on Tuesday morning. But &quot;Up in the Air&quot; was the critical darling with six nominations. Meryl Streep earned two nominations in the best actress category, one for her portrayal of Julia Child in this summer's hit, &quot;Julie and Julia,&quot; and another for her role in the romantic comedy &quot;It's Complicated,&quot; in theaters December 25. Sandra Bullock got two nominations, one for best actress in a comedic motion picture for &quot;The Proposal,&quot; and the other for best actress in a dramatic motion picture for her role in the sneak box-office success &quot;The Blind Side.&quot;On the small screen, fan favorite &quot;Glee&quot; pulled in four nominations, for best comedy or musical TV series, best actor, best actress, and best supporting actress. It was a huge year for animated motion pictures, with box-office hits like &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; earning nominations in the best animated feature category. &quot;We're flattered and honored with the support we've received for 'Up' throughout the year, and this is a humbling, happy year-end moment for us,&quot; said the film's director, Pete Docter. &quot;We spend years making these films and you never know how people will receive them, and we continue to be thrilled with the response. Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press for this incredible honor.&quot;Morgan Freeman, who received a nomination for best actor in a dramatic motion picture for his role in &quot;Invictus,&quot; also called it an incredible honor. &quot;Congratulations to Clint Eastwood and Matt Damon on their nominations, and I extend my deepest gratitude to my producing partner Lori McCreary, and the entire cast and crew of 'Invictus' for their tireless work to make a film befitting of Nelson Mandela's legacy,&quot; Freeman said. &quot;Playing Mandela was the greatest honor of my career, and I hope that I have done him proud.&quot; The nominees are:Best motion picture, drama&quot;Avatar&quot;&quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; &quot;Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire&quot;&quot;Up in the Air&quot; Best motion picture, musical or comedy &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot; &quot;The Hangover&quot; &quot;It's Complicated&quot; &quot;Julie and Julia&quot; &quot;Nine&quot;Best actor in a motion picture, dramaJeff Bridges, &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;George Clooney, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;Colin Firth, &quot;A Single Man&quot;Morgan Freeman, &quot;Invictus&quot;Tobey Maguire, &quot;Brothers&quot;Best actress in a motion picture, drama Emily Blunt, &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;Sandra Bullock, &quot;The Blind Side&quot;Helen Mirren, &quot;The Last Station&quot;Carey Mulligan, &quot;An Education&quot;Gabourey Sidibe, &quot;&quot;Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire&quot;Best performance by an actor in a motion picture, musical or comedyDaniel Day-Lewis, &quot;Nine&quot;Matt Damon, &quot;The Informant&quot;Robert Downey Jr., &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;Joseph Gordon-Levitt &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot;Michael Stuhlbarg, &quot;A Serious Man&quot;Best performance by an actress in a motion picture, musical or comedy Sandra Bullock, &quot;The Proposal&quot; Marion Cotillard, &quot;Nine&quot;Julia Roberts, &quot;Duplicity&quot;Meryl Streep, &quot;It's Complicated&quot; Meryl Streep, &quot;Julie and Julia&quot; Best performance by an actress in a supporting role in a motion picturePenelope Cruz, &quot;Nine&quot;Vera Farmiga, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;Anna Kendrick, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;Mo'Nique, &quot;Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire&quot;Julianne Moore, &quot;A Single Man&quot;Best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a motion pictureMatt Damon, &quot;Invictus&quot;Woody Harrelson, &quot;The Messenger&quot;Christopher Plummer, &quot;The Last Station&quot;Stanley Tucci, &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;Christoph Walz, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;Best animated feature film&quot;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs&quot;&quot;Coraline&quot;&quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;&quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;&quot;Up&quot;Best screenplay, motion pictureNeill Blomkamp, &quot;District 9&quot;Terri Tatchell and Mark Boal, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;Nancy Meyers, &quot;It's Complicated&quot;Jason Reitman, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;Sheldon Turner and Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;Best director, motion pictureKathryn Bigelow, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;James Cameron, &quot;Avatar&quot;Clint Eastwood, &quot;Invictus&quot;Jason Reitman, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;Quentin Tarantino, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;Best television series, comedy or musical&quot;30 Rock&quot;&quot;Entourage&quot;&quot;Glee&quot;&quot;Modern Family&quot;&quot;The Office&quot;Best TV series, drama &quot;Big Love&quot; &quot;Dexter&quot; &quot;House&quot; &quot;Mad Men&quot; &quot;True Blood&quot;Best performance by an actress in a TV series, comedyCourtney Cox, &quot;Cougar Town&quot;Edie Falco, &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;Tina Fey, &quot;30 Rock&quot;Lea Michelle, &quot;Glee&quot;Toni Collette, &quot;United States of Tara&quot;Best performance by an actor in a TV series, comedyAlec Baldwin, &quot;30 Rock&quot;Steve Carrell, &quot;The Office&quot;David Duchovny, &quot;Californication&quot;Thomas Jane, &quot;Hung&quot;Matthew Morrison, &quot;Glee&quot;Best performance by an actor in a TV series, dramaSimon Baker, &quot;The Mentalist&quot; Michael C.
