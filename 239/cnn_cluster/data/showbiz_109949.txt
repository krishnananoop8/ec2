^_^Title^_^'Twilight' star Pattinson says he and Stewart just 'good friends'^_^Story^_^Robert Pattinson would like to set the record straight, once and for all, on any supposed romantic link between him and his &quot;Twilight&quot; co-star Kristen Stewart.They are really just &quot;good friends,&quot; Pattinson said in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, but that's it -- and he finds rumors to the contrary frustrating.&quot;It doesn't make any difference what you say [to the tabloids],&quot; said Pattinson. &quot;I've literally been across the country [from Kristen], and it's like 'Oh, they were on secret dates!' It's like 'Where? I can't get out of my hotel room!' &quot;Stewart told the magazine she also finds the stories about the two of them infuriating.&quot;We're characters in this comic book,&quot; she said.Still, &quot;Twilight&quot; director Catherine Hardwicke told the magazine that the two actors shared an unmistakable chemistry on set.&quot;What Rob and Kristen had is a multitude of feelings for each other,&quot; said Hardwicke. &quot;Complex feelings for each other. It was what we needed. Complex, intense fascination.&quot; In the Vanity Fair interview, to appear in the magazine's December issue, Pattinson talked about his relationship with Stewart, as well as reservations he had early on in his acting career. The second movie in the series about teen vampires and forbidden love, &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon,&quot; comes out November 20.Pattinson said there was a point before &quot;Twilight&quot; where he almost gave up on acting completely.&quot;I was going to all these auditions and telling everyone how I got fired [from a play in London's West End] because I stood up for my principles. ... I kind of went nuts for a while,&quot; said Pattinson.He couldn't land another job, stopped talking to his agent, and began performing with a guitar in bars.But after receiving a role in a BBC thriller called &quot;The Haunted Airman,&quot; in which Pattinson appeared in a wheelchair and got to act like &quot;a weirdo,&quot; his outlook changed. &quot;I just changed my whole opinion about everything,&quot; he said, noting he was more willing to go for broke.Although it may seem now that Pattinson was born to play Edward Cullen, the brooding lead vampire in the movie franchise, director Hardwicke said the studio had doubts about casting him in the lead role.&quot;They called me up and they literally said, 'Catherine, do you think you can make this guy look good?' &quot; the director told Vanity Fair contributing editor Evgenia Peretz. &quot;So I said, 'Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to get his hair back to a different color, do a different style. He would work with a trainer from now on. My cinematographer is great with lighting. He will study the cheekbones, and I promise you, we'll make the guy look good.' &quot;Peretz said Pattinson comes across as self-deprecating and still coming to terms with fame. As he told her, &quot;I'm trying not to drown.&quot;&quot;I guess I'm not the type of guy cut out to do a franchise,&quot; he added. &quot;I'm not much of a crowd person.&quot; The December issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands in New York and Los Angeles on November 4 and nationally on November 10.Loading weather data ...
