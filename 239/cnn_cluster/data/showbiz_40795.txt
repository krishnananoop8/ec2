^_^Title^_^Donald Trump: I have the genes for success^_^Story^_^London, England Real estate tycoon and multi-billionaire Donald Trump says that he was born with the right set of genes that enabled him to have fame and fortune.&quot;Well I think I was born with the drive for success because I have a certain gene, Trump told CNN's Becky Anderson&quot;I'm a gene believer... hey when you connect two race horses you get usually end up with a fast horse,&quot; he said during the Connect the World interview.&quot;I had a good gene pool from the stand point of that so I was pretty much driven.&quot; Trump is currently worth an estimated $2 billion according to Forbes magazine.Much of his success came in New York City's real estate market, but he has also been the star of a TV series called &quot;The Apprentice&quot; where he is paid a reported $3 million per episode. During the interview, Trump -- whose personal life is regularly picked over in the pages of gossip magazines -- admitted finding it easier to manage his business than manage his home.&quot;The way I run my business seems to be easier than the way I run my life,&quot; Trump said. &quot;But I think all the time that I just don't want people to always just agree with me&quot;. At the end of the interview, Trump called Anderson a terrible interviewer and went on to 'fire' her from the show. &quot;Becky, you do a terrible job,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You're a lousy interviewer, that was the worst interview I ever had, you are fired!&quot;Thankfully for Anderson, it was a joke.Loading weather data ...
