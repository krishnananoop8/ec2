^_^Title^_^Grannies help business spin a good yarn ^_^Story^_^London Telling everyone you employ a team of grandmothers to do all your manual labor might, on the face of it, sound like commercial suicide. But for Katie Mowat it proved to be a stroke of genius.The 29-year-old founder and managing director of UK-based Grannies Inc. -- an online bespoke knitwear company -- is now enjoying her third year of trading after packing in her nine-to-five as an IT consultant in the City of London.&quot;The whole idea of the grannies marketing angle came when I was looking for knitters for the company. Most of them seemed to be older, so it was a kind of eureka moment when you just realize that it works very well from a marketing angle,&quot; Mowat said.A keen knitter herself, Mowat now has a team of knitters including granny's Paulette, Patsy and Margaret who help meet demand for a range of bespoke beanies, scarves, snoods and wrist warmers -- all made from 100% Merino wool.Her oldest knitter is 82, and plenty of grannies have their needles poised for action.&quot;We've got 12 who regularly knit for us and a waiting list of over 100!&quot; she said.It's a great idea, Mowat thinks, because the grannies can do as much or as little as they want and it gives them a bit of extra income -- they receive around a quarter of the retail price, which starts at &pound;34 (around $55).Chris Turner, managing editor of Springwise -- a website which tracks innovative new business ideas worldwide -- says locally-produced products like Mowat's knitwear can offer consumers something different from big multinational brands.&quot;Products produced in the local community do have a lot of inherent value because customers know where they come from, they understand the background and lots of these products come with a story attached -- like Grannies Inc, which is a lovely story for a consumer to tell their friends,&quot; Turner said.New technology gives a global reach for small businesses around the world, he says, and allows almost anything to be customized now.Turner points to the successes of Bamboosero, a company which supports bike building -- made from sustainable bamboo -- in developing countries, while the South African-based African Cartel showcases and sells the work of local African street artists.Mowat is confident that the consumer interest for locally produced products will endure.&quot;In the fashion industry there is definitely a trend towards ethical fashion. We're moving towards 'slow fashion' rather than throwaway high street,&quot; she said.&quot;I think it's important to provide traceability when it comes to a product and I think the idea of being able to link the customer to the actual manufacturer creates a really warm feeling. It makes you feel like you're doing some good,&quot; she added.Mowat's &quot;grand skein&quot; saw the addition of a new kids wear range recently, and she's planning a foray into the crafts market sometime soon.Consumers are realizing that this artisan approach to production is worth more, adding value that only real craftsmanship can deliver, Turner says.&quot;The kind of products that consumers get their status from and show off in public is definitely a trend that will grow and grow. The power of online technology to drive that is fantastic,&quot; he said.Loading weather data ...
