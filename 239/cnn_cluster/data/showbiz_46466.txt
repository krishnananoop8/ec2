^_^Title^_^Ten stars who followed Oscar-worthy performances with stinkers^_^Story^_^(The Frisky) -- Natalie Portman is getting a lot of Oscar buzz for her performance in &quot;Black Swan.&quot; And while the young actress certainly deserves the attention for the mind-bending role, we're a little concerned that a dud of a movie is about to hit theaters that could distract critics from her performance in the ballet thriller.

But Natalie would not be the first star who went from stellar performance to getting stuck in a stinker.From &quot;Dreamgirls to &quot;Norbit&quot;Apparently, a lot of people felt that Eddie Murphy's shot at winning an Oscar for his role in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; evaporated after his 2007 movie &quot;Norbit.&quot; For his role as James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early in &quot;Dreamgirls,&quot; Murphy took home a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award and earned an Oscar nomination (but not a win), but when &quot;Norbit&quot; dropped in theaters, the movie ended up winning eight Golden Raspberry &quot;Razzie&quot; awards.
