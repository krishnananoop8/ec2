^_^Title^_^All Blacks and Wallabies claim wins^_^Story^_^(CNN)  -- Southern hemisphere powers New Zealand and Australia began their Test campaigns in Europe with wins over Wales and England on Saturday.The All Blacks held off a late Welsh rally to win 19-12 in Cardiff while Australia came from behind at the half to see off England 18-9 at Twickenham.New Zealand have not lost to Wales since 1953 and that run rarely looked under threat despite the sides being tied at 6-6 at the interval in the Millenium StadiumFly-half opposites Stephen Jones and Dan Carter had shared the points with two penalties apiece, but after the break All Blacks star Carter imposed himself on the match.A second-half try by Andrew Hore, conveted by Carter, and two more penalties from his reliable boot gave them a substantial lead.But Jones hit back with two more penalties to cut the gap to seven points and an interception and charge for the line by giant lock Alun-Wyn Jones briefly raised home hopes.But Jones ran out of steam and could not find support to complete the move.Carter, who was named man of the match, ended the Test with jeers ringing in his ears after a high tackle on Martin Roberts which could land him in further trouble.Carter, who is two points behind the All Blacks Test record of 968 points by Andrew Mehrtens, apologized for the tackle after the match and praised the home effort.&quot;To hold on to the end was great for our guys, there's great self-belief in our side and great credit to Wales who played extremely well,&quot; he told BBC Sport.Earlier, the Australian Wallabies proved too strong for a Jonny Wilkinson inspired home side, who led 9-5 at halftime.Fly-half Wilkinson on his return to the Test arena gave England the early advantage with a typical drop-goal effort and a penalty.Young scrum half Will Genia conjured up an unconverted try for the visitors before a further Wilkinson penalty put England four points to the good at the break.But in the second half the Wallabies scored 13 unanswered points with Matt Giteau edging them ahead with two penalties.Adam Ashley-Cooper's converted try nine minutes from time sealed the win for the Wallabies, who will be playing all our home nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales on their tour and looking to emulate their grand slam success of 1984.Loading weather data ...
