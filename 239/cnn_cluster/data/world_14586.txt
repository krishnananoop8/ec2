^_^Title^_^Italian president re-elected by parliament ^_^Story^_^Rome Italy's parliament on Saturday re-elected President Giorgio Napolitano to a second term, a step that could help solve a political impasse.The 88-year-old is the first president to serve two terms. The result was met with large applause and also some protests. And, the election could help move Italy out of its current political gridlock.Italy's parliament had been at an impasse since February's general election left a three-way split between the right, the left and a wild-card party.While the Italian presidency is largely a ceremonial role, it can become a critical one in times of political crisis. The issue has been that, under the constitution, the Italian president cannot dissolve Parliament and call for new elections in the last six months of his mandate.
