^_^Title^_^'Lord of the Rings' alum creates 'Happy' app^_^Story^_^It's an epic journey from Middle Earth to the app store. But Monica Singh Haley has done it.Haley, who was manager of the animation department for 2003's &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot; and animation coordinator for the previous year's &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; has rolled out a mobile app. And, in its own way, it, too, is about fighting the powers of darkness.&quot;The Happy Apps,&quot; for the iPad and iPhone, is a set of mood-enhancement tools that include light therapy, color therapy and a &quot;Help Yourself Happiness Guide&quot; to help you decide which are right for you.The $1.99 app, which Haley says is probably most effective on the iPad, also includes a sleep therapy app which combines several of the tools for what she calls a more restful way to get to sleep and wake up.The project is the first for Haley, who before &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; worked with the video-game division at DreamWorks. More recently she's been taking some time to be a stay-at-home mom to her two children.&quot;I'd never really thought about apps, per se, but I thought about how I could use my background in visual effects and games to do something that was important and valuable in some way,&quot; she said. &quot;This was our first step. It's a tiny, little, fun app, but it's very me.&quot;The app's therapy techniques are inspired by personal interests, including yoga and her Indian roots, Haley said.She says her time on the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; projects also played a role in inspiring the pick-me-up app. (And it wasn't just from helping animate those cheery hobbits).&quot;We worked seven days a week for a year at a time,&quot; said Haley, who said she was considered the office &quot;mom&quot; for a 60-member animation crew. &quot;People get weak and they need a little encouragement and praise and to be taken care of.&quot;That team's work creating Academy Award-winning effects for the fantasy films provided some more practical guidance, she says.&quot;They were looking at those shots over and over again and they'd pick out these little things -- these little details,&quot; she said. &quot;After a while, you'd start noticing all these little glitches. &quot;I think I developed a better eye and better attention to detail that I was able to use for this.&quot; Also inspirational? Watching director Peter Jackson turn the classic fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien into a set of films. For decades, studios had shied away from such a massive undertaking, with some saying no movie (or movies) would ever be able to capture the epic scope of the good-versus-evil tale.&quot;It was a great experience,&quot; she said. &quot;Coming from games, where there are tight budgets and you're accountable to a million people ... this was Peter Jackson's movie, his company, and he wanted it done right.&quot;I really took that to heart,&quot; she added. &quot;There are always reasons you can't do something. It's always harder to do the very best thing. I decided right there that that's what I believe in.&quot;&quot;The Happy Apps&quot; was released Friday in Apple's app store. Haley said that if the app is successful there, versions for Android and other operating systems may be added.Loading weather data ...
