^_^Title^_^Recipe Makeover: Cheesy chicken enchiladas^_^Story^_^(Cooking Light)  -- A cheesy chicken casserole is revamped to meet a Texas reader's health goals.Anna Marie &quot;Rie&quot; Lotti, a life insurance broker from Katy, Texas says: &quot;My son-in-law, Marc, is from a traditional Mexican family, and we're Italian. This is a dish we all love because it's cheesy and good.&quot;It's a recipe that's been in her family for two decades. Lotti notes their lifestyle has changed a lot since she started making the casserole: Both she and her husband, Tom, keep tabs on sodium, saturated fat, and calories since Tom was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago.&quot;I'm glad my daughter, Dawn, sent the recipe to Cooking Light for a makeover,&quot; she says.CookingLight.com: Surprisingly unhealthy foodsThe dilemmaPlenty of cheese and sour cream, as well as canned cream of chicken soup, contributed to the hefty 773 calories per serving of this filling entr&eacute;e. Plus, the soup and abundant 2 pounds of cheese added to the dish's sodium content.The solutionCheese: Using half the amount of cheese and opting for a reduced-fat Mexican blend in the filling cut 149 calories, 13.4 grams of fat (8.4 grams saturated), and 126 milligrams of sodium per serving.Topping: We topped the casserole with one-fourth the original amount of cheese and employed a sharp reduced-fat cheddar to trim 97 calories, 8.3 grams of fat (5.2 grams saturated), and 134 milligrams of sodium per serving.CookingLight.com: Healthy Convenience Store FoodsSour cream: In place of 2 cups of the full-fat sour cream, we used a combination of 1 2/3 cups low-fat plain yogurt and 1/3 cup butter to shave 29 calories and about 4 grams of fat (2.4 grams saturated) per serving.Canned soup: We substituted a reduced-fat, reduced-sodium version of canned cream of chicken soup for a savings of 1.5 grams of fat and 102 milligrams of sodium per serving.Tortillas: Instead of frying the tortillas in oil, we brushed them with a prudent 1 tablespoon canola oil to keep fat and calories in check and pan-toasted them.The feedback&quot;The family thoroughly enjoyed the new version of the enchiladas,&quot; says Lotti. &quot;The tortillas were tender, and the filling was flavorful and creamy with extra onion and garlic and the combined [yogurt] and butter.&quot;Yield 8 servings (serving size: 1 enchilada)Ingredients * 2 1/2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast * 2 cups (8 ounces) preshredded reduced-fat 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese * 1 2/3 cups plain low-fat yogurt * 1/3 cup butter, melted * 1/4 cup chopped onion * 1 teaspoon minced garlic * 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper * 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup (such as Healthy Request), undiluted * 1 (4.5-ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained * 8 (8-inch) flour tortillas * 1 tablespoon canola oil * Cooking spray * 1/2 cup (2 ounces) finely shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese * 1/4 cup chopped green onionsCookingLight.com: The Best Light Scoops of SummerPreparation1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;.2. Combine first 9 ingredients in a large bowl. Remove 1 cup chicken mixture; set mixture aside.3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, brush oil over both sides of tortilla. Add tortilla to pan; cook 5 seconds on each side or until toasted and soft. Remove from pan; arrange 1/2 cup chicken mixture down center of tortilla. Roll jelly-roll style; place filled tortilla, seam side down, in a 13 x 9--inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Repeat procedure with remaining 7 tortillas, remaining oil, and remaining chicken mixture. Spread reserved 1 cup chicken mixture evenly over enchiladas. Cover and bake at 350&deg; for 20 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle evenly with cheddar cheese and green onions; bake an additional 5 minutes or until cheese melts.Wine note: Just as a crunchy green salad with mango will complement Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas, so too will a crisp, tropical fruit-filled California chardonnay, like Kali Hart Vineyard Chardonnay 2007 ($17). With its medium body and lively acidity, this white wine slices through creamy dairy products, like cheese and yogurt. A shot of citrus flavor and a nice bit of lingering sweetness also give it the ability to balance spicy chiles. -- Jeffery LindenmuthKitchen notes: Serve with a salad of fresh mango, jicama, and shredded lettuce topped with a lime vinaigrette.CookingLight.com: 8 healthy office snacksNutritional information Calories: 454 Fat: 20.3g (sat 10.4g,mono 6.7g,poly 1.5g) Protein: 30.8g Carbohydrate: 36.6g Fiber: 2.2g Cholesterol: 73mg Iron: 2.3mg Sodium: 757mg Calcium: 347mgCookingLight.com: Healthy foods that can kill youEnter for a chance to win in our $5,000 Grocery GiveawayCopyright 2011 Cooking Light magazine.
