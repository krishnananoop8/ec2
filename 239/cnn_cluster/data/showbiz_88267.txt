^_^Title^_^DirecTV's Spade-Farley ad criticized as in poor taste^_^Story^_^DirecTV has raised a ruckus by raising the dead.The satellite TV company has relied on dead celebrities to push its satellite television packages -- last year's &quot;Poltergeist&quot; ad starred the late Heather O'Rourke, for example -- but the cable company's latest promotion featuring Chris Farley in &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; has stirred up fresh controversy, with many believing that the ad was done in poor taste.The 30-second spot features Farley, who died in 1997 of heart failure because of an overdose, in the infamous &quot;Fat Boy in a Little Coat&quot; scene from the 1995 comedy that co-starred David Spade.The commercial looks like it was taken straight from the film reel, until Spade starts promoting DirecTV while Farley carries on his routine in the background.&quot;Great, I'm here with tons of fun, but I could be at home with DirecTV,&quot; Spade says in the commercial. &quot;It never gets old,&quot; he says after Farley busts the seams on the too-small jacket. What some viewers find especially shocking is that Spade, who wrote in a 1998 Rolling Stone article that he didn't attend Farley's funeral because he &quot;couldn't be in the same room where Chris was in a box,&quot; went along with the promotion.When Gawker.com's Defamer blog wrote about the ad, it earned the hashtag &quot;bad advertising,&quot; with the post addressing both Spade and the holders of Farley's estate as &quot;sleazebags.&quot; Over on WalletPop.com, the advertisement is called &quot;a monstrous lack of judgment.&quot; TVSquad is none too happy about it either, believing that the ad is &quot;unfunny and not very clever,&quot; and questions whether it's &quot;too soon&quot; to run an ad featuring Farley and &quot;why Spade even agreed to do it.&quot; Entertainment Weekly said it can't decide whether the advertisement is &quot;a sweet homage to a sexy moment or semi-disrespectful exploitation of the dead.&quot; It was intended to be neither, representatives for Spade and DirecTV said.&quot;When DirecTV came to me and the Farley family with this idea about 'Tommy Boy,' we talked and thought it would be a cool way to remind people just how funny Chris was,&quot; Spade said in a statement. &quot;It is a clever homage to my friend and a movie that we loved doing.&quot;As for DirecTV, they were taking cues from Farley's loved ones.&quot;We should look to Chris' family and friends for the ultimate opinion on this subject,&quot; said Jon Gieselman, senior vice president of advertising and public relations for DirecTV. &quot;They were on board with the concept from the very beginning and throughout the entire process and felt the spot was a great to tribute to Chris.&quot; Decide for yourself whether the commercial is truly offensive by viewing it here.Loading weather data ...
