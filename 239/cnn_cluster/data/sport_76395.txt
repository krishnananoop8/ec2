^_^Title^_^World champion Janka adds Olympic title^_^Story^_^(CNN)  -- World champion Carlo Janka of Switzerland added the men's Olympic giant-slalom title to his list of honors on Tuesday -- after Bode Miller skied out in his attempt to claim a record fourth medal at the Vancouver Games.American Miller, who was attempting to become the first skier in history to stand on the podium four times in one Olympic Games, missed a gate in his first run and was subsequently disqualified, although he still has Saturday's men's slalom to come in his attempts to make history.Janka held a tiny advantage of just 0.02 seconds after his opening run, but he extended his lead to 0.39 seconds after the second run, to finish ahead of Norwegian pair Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Svindal -- who was also claiming his third medal of the Games. Janka's victory maintains Switzerland's superb form in the Games, following Didier Defago's downhill victory and Silvan Zurbriggen's bronze in the super-combined.&quot;It was perfect for me, the snow was hard but not icy, good grip, perfect conditions,&quot; Janka told the official Olympic Web site.&quot;You must always take a lot of risks. I made no big mistakes from top to finish and that was the key today.&quot; Speed skatingThere was drama in the men's 10,000 meters when Dutchman Sven Kramer was disqualified after failing to switch lanes properly two thirds through the race.Kramer was hot favorite to add the title to his 5,000m gold medal and clocked an Olympic record time of 12 minutes 54.50 seconds in coming home first.However, his disqualification meant Korean Lee Seung-Hoon took a surprise gold in 12:58.55, also an Olympic record.
