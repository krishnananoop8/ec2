^_^Title^_^Formula One 2012: Mercedes^_^Story^_^Having taken over the world champion Brawn GP team ahead of the 2010 season, Mercedes have struggled to be serious title contenders in the past two years.Despite a driver line-up including legendary German Michael Schumacher and his promising compatriot Nico Rosberg, the team again placed fourth last year and have earned only three podium finishes in that period.The German manufacturer previously left F1 in 1955 after a two-year stint which earned two drivers' titles, but has not placed in the top three since Rosberg did so at the 2010 British Grand Prix.Team principal Ross Brawn is no stranger to success, however, having also overseen six constructors' titles and five drivers' championships during a decade with Ferrari when Schumacher dominated F1.Michael SchumacherThe seven-time world champion has been short of his peerless best since coming out of retirement in 2010, being outperformed by Rosberg for the last two years.F1's most decorated driver showed glimpses of his old self at last year's Canadian Grand Prix, where he coped admirably with treacherous conditions to finish fourth.The 43-year-old is entering the final year of his contract and will not want to tarnish his formidable reputation with a third indifferent season in a row.If 2012 is Schumacher's final year in F1, he will want to add to his record haul of 91 grand prix wins before bowing out once and for all.Nico RosbergRosberg finished seventh in the drivers' standings for the second year in a row in 2011 as he again outshone his illustrious teammate.The 26-year-old's best finishes were in China and Turkey, where he crossed the line in fifth.Rosberg, the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg, will want to return to -- and improve upon -- the form which saw him clinch three podium placings in 2010.The former Williams driver committed his future to Mercedes in October 2011, and will be determined to achieve the first grand prix win of his career after 108 F1 starts so far.ResultsAustralia: Rosberg 12th, Schumacher DNFMalaysia: Schumacher 10th, Rosberg 13thChina: Rosberg 1st, Schumacher DNFBahrain: Rosberg 5th, Schumacher 10thSpain: Rosberg 7th, Schumacher DNFMonaco: Rosberg 2nd, Schumacher DNFCanada: Rosberg 6th, Schumacher DNFEurope: Schumacher 3rd, Rosberg 6thBritain: Schumacher 7th, Rosberg 15thGermany: Schumacher 7th, Rosberg 10thHungary: Rosberg 10th, Schumacher 10thBelgium: Schumacher 7th, Rosberg 11thItaly: Schumacher 6th, Rosberg 7thSingapore: Rosberg 5th, Schumacher DNFJapan: Schumacher 11th, Rosberg DNFKorea: Schumacher 13th, Rosberg DNFIndia: Rosberg 11th, Schumacher 22ndAbu Dhabi: Schumacher 11th, Rosberg DNFBrazil: Schumacher 7th, Rosberg 15thLoading weather data ...
