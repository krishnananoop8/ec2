^_^Title^_^Black Caviar continues winning streak with dramatic win at Ascot ^_^Story^_^Shaves don't come much closer than they did on Saturday when Black Caviar maintained her unbeaten record by the narrowest of margins in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot.It took a photo finish to separate her from her French raider Moonlight Cloud, who had tracked her every step of the way with Restiadargent coming in third.With 200 meters to go, the Australian mare was two lengths clear and coasting to victory, but as jockey Luke Nolen eased up her rivals closed in, almost pipping her at the post."It was an error that every apprentice is taught not to do, and I got away with it today," Nolen said."I hope my performance hasn't overshadowed what was a great effort by the stable," he added.There was an audible sigh of the relief from the traveling Australian fans as it was confirmed that she had won by a short head -- defending her unbeaten record and increasing her winning streak to 22."I am happy to come here and win, and we have done that," trainer, Peter Moody said after the result was announced."We never expect dominance, she gets the job done and we're extremely proud of her," he added.Ascot was turned into a sea of salmon and black as racegoers of all nationalities showed up to support the "Wonder From Down Under."A capacity crowd of 80,000 people packed the racecourse with 3,000 of those having flown all the way from Australia to get a glimpse of their hero.Rise of the celebrity ownerThe red-hot favorite was sent off at odds of one to seven ON -- meaning a seven dollar bet would earn you just one dollar.Perhaps fittingly, the Queen herself presented the trophy to the Queen of the Turf and her connections --Moody and Nolen.Moody hinted that retirement was a possibility if she doesn't show any sparkle when she returns home to Australia.The mare will be going into quarantine on Sunday in preparation for her return home rather than stay in Europe for the July Cup at Newmarket, as had originally been suggested.Loading weather data ...
