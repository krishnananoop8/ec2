^_^Title^_^Adele all the rage at Grammy nominations^_^Story^_^Los Angeles Even though Kanye West walked off with the most Grammy nominations Wednesday night, the chatter backstage was all about Adele.West's seven nominations was one more than that of the 23-year-old British songstress. And she was the clear favorite among many of the artists to take home the most trophies at next February's awards show."I feel sorry for anybody whose got to go up against Adele this year," said country artist Jason Aldean, who said he was thankful Adele was not competing in the three categories he is nominated for.Bruno Mars's "Doo Wops &amp; Holligans" is pitted against Adele's "21" for album of the year and record of the year.Mars gathered six nominations Wednesday, adding to the seven he got last year."Adele's awesome, but I heard she beats up little puppies," Mars joked backstage after the live Grammys nominations telecast Wednesday night.Kimberly Perry, lead vocalist for best new artist nominee The Band Perry, said Adele's "21" album is the most-often played music on the group's tour bus.It's uncertain if Adele will have recovered enough from this month's throat surgery to sing at the February 12 show, Recording Academy President Neil Portnow said. The procedure to repair a "recurrent vocal cord hemorrhage" forced cancellation of the remainder of her 2011 shows.Wednesday night's one-hour Grammy nominations telecast began and ended with Lady Gaga performances, including a finale with country duo Sugarland.Gaga, nominated in three categories, is up against Adele for the highest honor -- album of the year -- with "Born This Way."In addition to Adele, Mars and Gaga, the album of the year nominees include Foo Fighters' "Wasting Light" and Rihanna's "Loud."Other artists with impressive collections of nominations include Lil Wayne and Skrillex with five each.Indie favorites Bon Iver is up for four Grammys, including best new artist, best song and best record.Album Of The Year:21-- AdeleWasting Light-- Foo FightersBorn This Way-- Lady GagaDoo-Wops &amp; Hooligans-- Bruno MarsLoud-- RihannaRecord Of The Year:"Rolling In The Deep"-- Adele"Holocene"-- Bon Iver"Grenade"-- Bruno Mars"The Cave"-- Mumford &amp; Sons"Firework"-- Katy PerryBest New Artist:The Band PerryBon IverJ.
