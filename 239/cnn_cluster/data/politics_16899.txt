CNN's Anderson Cooper returns to the Gulf Coast to see what has changed since Hurricane Katrina. Don't miss &quot;In Katrina's Wake,&quot; an &quot;AC360&deg;&quot; special at 10 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN.  The federal government will award $1.8 billion to New Orleans schools damaged by Hurricane Katrina, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said Wednesday.A provision in an appropriations bill authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide a lump-sum payment for K-12 schools damaged by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.&quot;The provision also reduced penalties for insufficient flood insurance and alternate projects, which yielded more than $500 million in savings for Louisiana schools,&quot; Landrieu's office said in a statement.&quot;This $1.8 billion lump sum settlement is one of the great victories in our fight for a smarter recovery,&quot; Landrieu said.&quot;It was a battle worth waging and while we would have liked to have received the money sooner, it was worth the wait. This lump sum approach is a much wiser investment of taxpayer dollars and should serve as a model for the right way to rebuild communities following a major disaster.&quot;New Orleans schools are still rebounding five years after Katrina struck.The money gives &quot;local leaders the ability to rebuild New Orleans' school system in a comprehensive and strategic manner, instead of using a uncoordinated and piecemeal approach,&quot; Landrieu's statement said.The Orleans Parish School Board and the Recovery School District are reducing the number of campuses from 127 to 87.Loading weather data ...
