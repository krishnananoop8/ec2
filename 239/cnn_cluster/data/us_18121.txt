^_^Title^_^No link between library fire and Boston Marathon blasts^_^Story^_^A fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was not connected to two blasts at the Boston Marathon, the city's fire department confirmed Thursday."There was a lot of speculation it was related, but when all was said and done it turned out to be a careless disposal of smoking material," said Steve MacDonald, a Boston Fire Department spokesman.Six minutes after the explosions near the marathon finish line on Monday, firefighters responded to the blaze at the library in Dorchester, Massachusetts.The library, a well known landmark, is about five miles southeast of the marathon's finish line, and speculation immediately surged that there was a connection.Boston's police commissioner initially told reporters there had been an explosion at the library, but police later said the incident there was fire-related.The library fire occurred in an outside area where employees take breaks, the fire department said.
