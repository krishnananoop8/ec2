^_^Title^_^Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate^_^Story^_^Every debate seems destined to have a break-out meme. In the first round, it was Big Bird. This time it was Mitt Romney's binder full of women, which instantly became a trending hashtag, Twitter handle, a Facebook group and a Tumblr. (Talking about his effort to hire women for his cabinet, Romney said "And I brought us whole binders full of, of women.")Other popular, bipartisan bits of mockery covered the far livelier and sometimes cringe-inducing tone of the debate, shout outs to Mr. Gas, Mr. Coal and Mr. Oil, the candidates difficulty saying the name Lorraine and the audience members themselves.Twitter says there were 7.2 million tweets during the 90-minute debate. The most popular moments were an immigration question, Obama's comment to Romney on China and Romney's response to a question about raising taxes.Here are some of our favorite tweets of the night.
