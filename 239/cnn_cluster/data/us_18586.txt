^_^Title^_^Texas inmate accused of mailing threats to U.S. attorney^_^Story^_^A Texas inmate has been accused of making threats against law enforcement, prosecutors said Wednesday.Jesse Brister, known as "Bozo," was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on two counts of mailing threatening communications to law enforcement, prosecutors said.The indictment claims Brister, 27, of Conroe, on March 21 and March 28 mailed to the U.S. attorney in Dallas communication "that contained a threat to injure someone in retaliation for the prosecution of members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas," federal prosecutors said in a statement."Based on the serious nature of the threats in these letters, resources were diverted from important investigations, such as those in Kaufman County, to investigate these threats, which ultimately proved to be hoaxes," said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Sarah R. Saldaña.The bodies of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were discovered on March 30 at their home, almost exactly two months after McLelland's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, was killed in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse.Suspicions abound over whether the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas played a role in their killings. Authorities have not officially linked the two slayings, nor do they know whether the white supremacist group ordered the attacks.Two other men have been accused by Kaufman County authorities of threatening the safety of public officials.On Friday, the Kaufman County Sheriff's Department said it charged Robert Alan Miller, 52, of Terrell, with one count of making a terroristic threat. Officials said he threatened a deputy district attorney in a posting on a news website.Earlier, authorities arrested Nick Morale, 56, on one charge of making a terroristic threat after he allegedly threatened a county official.An arrest affidavit alleges that Morale called the county's Crime Stoppers tip line last week, saying a county official "would be the next victim."Authorities said there is nothing to link Miller or Morale to the killings of the McLellands or Hasse. They have declined to release the names of those who were threatened.
