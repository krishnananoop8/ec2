Now there's something new on the horizon that could revolutionize this burgeoning technology: 4-D printing.At TED 2013, senior fellow Skylar Tibbits sat down with CNN Ideas to further explain this mysterious fourth dimension in printing technology. He also provided us with visual examples from his Self-Assembly Lab, MIT.
