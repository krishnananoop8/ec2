^_^Title^_^Apple-1 computer sells for $213,000^_^Story^_^One of Apple's first computers has sold for more than $200,000.Perhaps the buyer didn't hear about Apple's online sale on Friday?The Apple-1 computer -- among the first made in a garage by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak -- sold for about $213,600 at a Christie's auction held in London, England, on Tuesday, according to the company's website. A private collector named Marco Boglione purchased the machine, according to the Associated Press. The Apple-1 computer came with a typed note from Jobs as well as a box stamped with the company's original logo -- an apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton. The computer originally sold for $666.66.The Apple-1 holds a place in tech history because it was easy enough for anyone to use (i.e., users didn't have to weld the motherboard together, as was the case with previous &quot;home&quot; computers, according to Christie's). It helped popularize at-home computing and led to the computer revolution.Jobs and Wozniak built the Apple-1 starting in 1976. Since then, the company has become one of the hottest producers of computers and gadgets on the market , with flagship products like the iPhone, iPad and iPod. People at the auction in London used some of these devices to document the Apple-1's sale, the Associated Press story notes. The AP also reported that Wozniak attended Tuesday's auction and added his own signed letter to the winning lot.Christie's had estimated the Apple-1 would sell for $160,000 to $240,000, and a Christie's spokesman told the Wall Street Journal's &quot;Tech Europe&quot; blog that the $213,000 sale price is a new record for any personal computer at auction.About 200 Apple-1 computers were produced, and they fetched substantially lower prices at earlier auctions. Wired explains more on that:&quot;Despite its incredible rarity, the Apple-1 has previously been known to fetch at best $50,000 at auction, and typically garners more like $14,000 to $16,000.&quot;Loading weather data ...
