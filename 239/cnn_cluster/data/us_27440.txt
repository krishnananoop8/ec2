Authorities say the 70-year-old was the man who shot three people, one of whom died, in an office building in nearby Phoenix on Wednesday.A 2013 Kia Optima that Harmon was seen fleeing in was found nearby, police said.Harmon had gone to an office building on Wednesday to discuss "some type of litigation," Phoenix Police Sgt. Tommy Thompson told CNN affiliate KTVK.After the meeting, around 10:30 a.m., Harmon shot Steven Singer, 48, who later died at a hospital; a 43-year-old man who was in critical condition, and a 32-year-old woman, Thompson said.The law firm of Osborn Maledon identified one of its attorneys, Mark Hummels, as one of the victims. He was involved in a client mediation when he was shot, the Phoenix firm said."We believe the two men were his targets," Thompson said. The woman, whose injury was not life-threatening, "just happened to be in the way when the shooting occurred."Former astronaut Mark Kelly referred to the shooting Wednesday as he testified on gun violence during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington.Kelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, this month launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, which seeks to raise money to counter the influence of the gun lobby.Two years ago, Giffords was shot in the head by a gunman in a parking lot in Tucson, Arizona.
