^_^Title^_^England's Tuilagi cautioned for ferry jump^_^Story^_^Center Manu Tuilagi compounded England's Rugby World Cup woes on Sunday when he was cautioned by police in New Zealand after jumping from a ferry.The Samoa-born England international has been fined by the team after he jumped from a boat and swam to a nearby pier as the vessel was preparing to dock.Tuilagi, 20, was part of the England team beaten 19-12 by France in the quarterfinals on Saturday, bringing to an end a campaign blighted by off-field controversy for the 2003 world champions.France and Wales reach semifinals"I'm really sorry," Tuilagi said in a Rugby Football Union (RFU) statement. "It was a silly thing to do and I apologize to everybody for any inconvenience caused."England coach Martin Johnson, who captained his country to victory at the 2003 tournament, condemned Tuilagi's actions as irresponsible."This was an irresponsible thing to do," Johnson was reported to have said by Reuters. "Manu has been disciplined internally and I have warned him about his future conduct."The RFU said the fine would be donated to a charity called the World Cup Christchurch Appeal, which supports communities affected by the earthquakes in the region earlier this year.The fine is the second Tuilagi has picked up since the tournament began, after he was also reprimanded for breaking International Rugby Board (IRB) regulations regarding advertising by wearing a branded mouthguard.Two of England's coaches were also banned from their final Pool B match against Scotland for illegally switching the match ball during a 67-3 win over Romania.Loading weather data ...
